"ACCESS","A Case Controlled Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis (ACCESS)","Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disorder of unknown cause that is characterized by activation of T-lymphocytes and macrophages. For many years sarcoidosis was presumed to be an atypical manifestation of tuberculosis because of the similarity between the inflammatory responses of the two diseases. However, as culture techniques became more widely employed to diagnose tuberculosis and it became less common, it became clear that sarcoidosis was not simply a variation of tuberculosis. Data on the etiology of sarcoidosis have come from diverse sources: in clinical investigations, alveolitis has been found to precede granulomatous inflammation; in case control studies, familial aggregation has been identified; and in case reports, recurrence of granulomatous inflammation has been observed after lung transplantation. The cause may not prove to be a single, known exposure. Interactions of exposures with genetic dispositions could have important implications for our understanding of immune responses as well as the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.","The initial presentation of sarcoidosis is related to sex, race and age, and it tends to remain stable over two years in the majority of patients. The etiology is probably multifactoral with both genetic and environmental factors contributing.","Sarcoidosis, Lung Diseases","To determine the etiology of sarcoidosis by establishing a case control, multi-center study. In addition to etiology, this study also sought to examine socioeconomic variables and the clinical course of patients with sarcoidosis, including quality of life.","736 patients with sarcoidosis enrolled within 6 months of diagnosis from 10 clinical centers in the U.S. Using the ACCESS sarcoidosis assessment system, organ involvement was determined for the whole group and for subgroups differentiated by sex, race, and age (<40 or 40 and older). Cases were matched with a control, and there was a two-year follow-up on cases. The ACCESS group proposed an instrument fo defining organ involvement in sarcoidosis. Biological specimens included DNA, plasma, and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were obtained. The data set includes 718 cases, 686 controls, and two-year follow-up data on 241 cases."
"ARIC","Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC)","At the time of project initiation, the NHLBI had long recognized the need for longitudinal studies to identify the biochemical and physiological markers and specific environmental factors which place individuals at high risk for the major atherosclerosis diseases. The development of reliable ultrasound examination of peripheral arteries enhanced the expected benefit of such studies. Community surveillance planning began for ARIC in response to recommendations of the 1978 NHLBI Workshop on the Decline in CHD Mortality and has been extended in its purpose to evaluate the large geographic differences in U.S. mortality.","","Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Diseases, Atherosclerosis, Heart Failure, Heart Failure, Congestive, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Disease, Coronary Heart Disease Risk Reduction","The objectives of ARIC are to: 1) investigate associations of factors, including those not previously measured in cohort studies, with prevalence of atherosclerosis and incidence of CHD, clinical stroke and other cardiovascular diseases; and 2) measure cardiovascular disease occurrence and trends and relate these to community levels of, and changes in, risk factors, medical care and atherosclerosis.","Black and white men and women, age 45-64 at entry; sample size: 15,792."
"BHS","Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS)","Lifestyle attributes such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and a high-fat, high calorie diet, begin in childhood and are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. While clinical cardiovascular disease occurs later in life, the characteristics of atherosclerosis, hypertension and diabetes can be present in childhood. The Bogalusa Heart Study began in 1973 as a long term study of the early natural history of cardiovascular disease in a semirural parish of Bogalusa, Louisiana. More than 16,000 individuals, many with multiple exams, have participated in the Bogalusa Heart Study. Subjects have ranged in age from birth to 38 years.","","Heart Diseases, Atherosclerosis, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Coronary Disease","To investigate the early natural history of cardiovascular disease in a cohort of children and young adults in a biracial, semirural community.","The Bogalusa dataset includes 11,796 participants that attended at least one of seven cross-sectional pediatric exams and/or the 1995-96 adult examination. Subjects were ranged in age from 3 to 20 years at the pediatric exams and 20-37 at the time of the adult exam."
"CHS","Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)","The study originated in 1988 from the recommendations of an NHLBI workshop on the management of CHD in the elderly. This is the most extensive study undertaken by the NHLBI to study CVD exclusively in an elderly population. Initially funded for six years, it was renewed for a second six year period in 1994 and recently was renewed for continued morbidity and mortality follow-up.","","Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Diseases, Heart Failure, Congestive, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cerebrovascular Accident, Hypertension, Coronary Disease","The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a study of risk factors for development and progression of CHD and stroke in people aged 65 years and older. The objectives of the Cardiovascular Health Study are to: 1) quantify associations of conventional and hypothesized risk factors with CHD and stroke; 2) assess the associations of non-invasive measures of subclinical disease with the incidence of CHD and stroke; 3) quantify the associations of risk factors with subclinical disease; 4) characterize the natural history of CHD and stroke, and identify factors associated with clinical course; and 5) describe the prevalence and distributions of risk factors, non-invasive measures of subclinical disease, and clinical CHD and stroke.","The 5,888 study participants were recruited from four U.S. communities and have undergone extensive clinic examinations for evaluation of markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease. The original cohort totaled 5,201 participants. A new cohort was recruited in 1992. The 687 participants in the new cohort are predominately African-American and were recruited at three of the four field centers."
"CARDIA","Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)","CARDIA is designed to increase understanding of contributors to changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors during the critical years of transition from young adulthood to middle age. CARDIA was funded initially in 1983 for a five year cycle that included two rounds of examinations. Contract renewals have allowed for subsequent re-examinations.","","Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Diseases, Obesity, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Coronary Disease","The original objectives of CARDIA were to document levels of risk factors for coronary artery disease and potential determinants of these risk factors in young adults; to study the interrelationships of risk factors and lifestyles and to document behavioral and environmental changes during the transition from young adulthood to middle age; to compare cross-sectional and longitudinal data on age-related trends in cardiovascular disease risk factors; and to compare levels and evolution of risk factors between men and women, blacks and whites, and in groups of differing socioeconomic status. Goals of the study have evolved to emphasize understanding determinants of left ventricular mass, emerging obesity and hypertension, and sequelae of hypertension in pregnancy.","Black and white men and women; ages 18-30 years at entry with a range of attained education; sample size: 5,115."
"FHS-Cohort","Framingham Heart Study-Cohort (FHS-Cohort)","The Framingham Study began in 1948 under the U.S. Public Health Service and was transferred under the direct operations of the new National Heart Institute, NIH, in 1949. Participants were sampled from Framingham, Massachusetts, including both men and women. This was the first prospective study of cardiovascular disease and identified the concept of risk factors and their joint effects. The study has continued to examine participants every two years and is currently supported by a contract to Boston University from the NHLBI, and from many grants for specialized studies.","","Arterial Occlusive Diseases, Heart Diseases, Atherosclerosis, Heart Failure, Heart Failure, Congestive, Peripheral Vascular Diseases, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cerebrovascular Accident, Hypertension, Coronary Disease","The objectives of the Framingham Study are to study the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors, trends in CVD incidence and its risk factors over time, and familial patterns of CVD and risk factors. Other important objectives include the estimation of incidence rates of disease and description of the natural history of cardiovascular disease, including the sequence of clinical signs and systems that precede the clinically recognizable syndrome and the consequences and course of clinically manifest disease.","At entry to the study in 1948-1952, the study recruited 5,209 men and women, ages 28-62 years, living in Framingham, MA. As of February 28, 1999, there are 993 surviving participants."
"FHS-OS","Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring (OS) and OMNI 1 Cohorts","With the aging of the Framingham cohort and with interest in familiar aggregation and heritability, a new cohort consisting of the offspring of the original cohort was sampled. Spouses of offspring were also included. This new sample, begun in 1971, constituted a second generation of participants, permitted new assessment of risk factors and outcomes, and provided a resource for the genetic analyses which were yet to come. The Offspring participants have had repeated examinations, though at longer intervals than the cohort.","","Arterial Occlusive Diseases, Heart Diseases, Atherosclerosis, Heart Failure, Heart Failure, Congestive, Peripheral Vascular Diseases, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cerebrovascular Accident, Hypertension, Coronary Disease","The objectives of the Framingham Offspring Study are to study the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors, trends in CVD incidence and its risk factors over time, family patterns of CVD and risk factors. Less prominent but important objectives include the estimation of incidence rates of disease and description of the natural history of cardiovascular disease, including the sequence of clinical signs and systems that precede the clinically recognizable syndrome, and the consequences and course of clinically manifest disease.","5,124 men and women, ages 5-70 years at entry consisting of offspring of the original Framingham cohort (and spouses of the offspring) participated in the study.

In 1994, the Omni Cohort 1 enrolled 507 men and women of African-American, Hispanic, Asian, Indian, Pacific Islander and Native American origins, who at the time of enrollment were residents of Framingham and the surrounding towns."
"COBLT","Cord Blood Transplantation Study (COBLT)","Compared to other stem cell sources, cord blood is easier and safer to procure, has no donor attrition, a limitless supply, reduced viral transmission, less acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease, is rich in hematopoietic progenitor cells, and immaturity of T-cell-mediated immunity. However, cord blood also has delayed neutrophil and platelet engraftment, a prolonged immune reconstitution, uncertain graft-versus-tumor activity, and cell doses from single cord blood units are a limiting factor for larger recipients.","","Leukemia, Anemia, Aplastic, Fanconi Anemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Neoplasms, Hematologic Diseases, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Severe Combined Immunodeficiency","The transplant center protocol was a phase II multicenter trial to determine if banked unrelated donor umbilical cord blood could serve as an adequate hematopoietic stem cell source for adults and children with malignancies, immune deficiencies, inherited marrow failure, or inborn errors of metabolism. The largest strata studied pediatric patients with various leukemias. Each participating transplant center used the same patient selection criteria, preparative regimen for patients in the same class, initial graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, indications for the use of cytokines, definitions for events and complications, and methods for evaluating immune reconstitution. The main study evaluated the impact of HLA 3/6 and 4/6 matching on outcome. The primary endpoint was 180-day disease free survival after UCBU transplantation. Secondary endpoints included engraftment, the frequency and severity of acute and chronic GvHD with stratification by degree of HLA match, overall survival, and immunologic reconstitution. Search activity was initiated in November 1998 and the first UCBU transplant was in March 1999. Enrollment in the COBLT transplant protocol ended December 31, 2003 with the accrual of 364 transplant recipients.",""
"HHP","Honolulu Heart Program (HHP)","The Honolulu Heart Program was initiated in 1965 by the NHLBI as a prospective study of environmental and biological causes of cardiovascular disease among Japanese Americans living in Hawaii. This population was known to have low incidence of coronary heart disease and higher incidence of stroke. The study provided opportunities to investigate relationships among disease frequencies, pathologic findings, and disease predictors in the cohort and to compare the findings in this population with those in other populations, especially cohorts of Japanese men resident in Japan or the U.S.","","Dementia, Emphysema, Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal, Lung Diseases, Obstructive, Myocardial Infarction, Asthma, Heart Diseases, Heart Failure, Heart Failure, Congestive, Bronchitis, Cardiovascular Diseases, Cerebrovascular Accident, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Hypertension, Coronary Disease","The initial objectives of the Honolulu Heart Program were to: 1) estimate morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke among Japanese men in Honolulu; 2) compare morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke among Japanese men in Japan, Honolulu, and San Francisco; 3) investigate relationships among risk factors, coronary heart disease, and stroke in Japanese men in Honolulu; 4) compare distributions of risk factors among men in Japan, Honolulu, and San Francisco, and relate similarities and differences in risk factors to the occurrence of disease in these areas and in other populations, including Framingham and Puerto Rico; 5) conduct an autopsy study, and to relate pathological findings to morbidity and mortality data; and 6) investigate relationships between risk factors and pathological evidence of atherosclerosis and its complications.","American men of Japanese ancestry born in 1900-1919 and living on the island of Oahu in 1965; age at entry 28-62 years; sample size: 8,006."
"LRC-PS","Lipid Research Clinics (LRC) Prevalence Study (PS)","An association between serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease is well established. A system was developed for classifying hyperlipoproteinemias into six types of patterns, as a basis for characterizing lipoprotein disorders. The Lipid Research Clinics was thus created to improve the detection of and clinical management of hyperlipoproteinemias. The three primary abjectives were: 1) to acquire data on the prevalence of different types of hyperlipoproteinemia in various age and ethnic groups, with special emphasis on the nature and frequency of genetic forms; 2) to collect reliable data on the prevalence and incidence of atherosclerosis in different types of hyperlipoproteinemia; and 3) to conduct an intervention trial to determine if lowering plasma lipid levels would reduce the risk of CHD.","Data from this study confirm findings from earlier studies in developed countries, showing age-related differences in plasma lipid levels. However, for overall distributions, the LRC data showed slightly lower cholesterol and markedly higher trigylceride values than those previously reported for North America. Some variation in plasma lipid values was evident among the clinic populations.

The large number of participants within most subgroups permitted a variety of analytic and comparative studies. For example, data from the large pediatric population revealed a drop in plasma cholesterol levels in adolescent males and females. Males aged 20-50 years had higher cholesterol levels than females in the same age group, and higher trigylceride levels bewteen ages 20-70 years. Numbers were also sigfficient for meaningful comparisons between lipid distributions of females who were taking sex hormones and those who were not; in females taking sex hormones, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher for subjects younger than 45 years, but slightly lower after age 45, than lipid levels in females not taking hormones (Circulation 1979; 60(2):427-439).","Myocardial Ischemia, Heart Diseases, Coronary Disease, Cardiovascular Diseases","The LRC Program began in 1971 under the sponsorship of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health. Part of this program was the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study, a standardized series of cross-sectional surveys of various North American populations designed to determine the prevalence of dyslipidemias and to describe the distributions of lipids and lipoproteins in major ethnic and social groups. In addition to contributing to the aggregate analysis, each independent population-based study was designed with capabilities for separate analyses of lipid and lipoprotein distributions. The participating populations were not selected to be a probability sample representative of the North American population per se, but by virtue of their size and economic and geographical diversity, they provide a useful cross-sectional group.

The Family Study was the third phase of the Lipids Research Clinics North American Population Studies. The Family Study was designed to obtain knowledge of the distribution of lipids and lipoproteins among family members and of the association of familial and genetic attributes to dyslipoproteinemias.","The populations of the study fall into three categories: occupational groups, household or residential groups, and school children and their parents. The occupational groups were ascertained through their employers; the household groups typically were ascertained through canvassing of residential areas; and children and their parents were screened by determining the children in school and contacting their parents."
"NGHS","NHLBI Growth and Health Study (NGHS)","Obesity is a major contributing factor to several predictors of coronary heart disease such as hypertension, a poor lipid profile and diabetes. Both genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in the development of obesity, and there is evidence to suggest that obesity in childhood will likely carry over into adulthood. Prevention of obesity in early childhood could provide significant long term health benefits. A greater understanding of the factors contributing to childhood obesity is required for the establishment of effective weight reduction intervention programs. To this end, the National Growth and Health Study was initiated in 1985 as a multicenter study of the development of obesity among black and white pre-adolescent girls.","","Heart Diseases, Obesity, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Coronary Disease","To investigate racial differences in dietary, physical activity, family, and psychosocial factors associated with the development of obesity from pre-adolescence through maturation between African-American and white girls. Secondarily, the NGHS sought to examine the effects of obesity on cardiovascular disease risk factors.","The NHLBI National Growth and Health Study recruited girls 9 and 10 years of age in two communities (Richmond, California and Cincinnati, Ohio) and also from families enrolled in a health maintenance organization in the Washington, D.C. area. A total of 2,379 girls were enrolled in the study between 1987-88 and were followed for 9 years. Slightly more than half of the cohort was African-American."
"NLMS","National Longitudinal Mortality Study (NLMS)","Large national studies of mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality, by occupation, industry, income, education or other socioeconomic factors are rare. From the studies that do exist, however, it is clear that strong relationships exist between socioeconomic factors and mortality. These relationships may be influenced by and may account for differences in mortality by race, ethnic origin, or geographic factors. To study these relationships in detail, large studies, inclusive of the ethnic, social and economic diversity of the U.S., are needed.","","Heart Diseases, Cardiovascular Diseases","To investigate social, economic, demographic and occupational differentials in mortality (total and by cause) within a national sample of the U.S. population.","A series of cross-sectional, national samples of the U.S. population, as identified from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC – formerly the Current Population Survey) of the Bureau of the Census. The latest release of NLMS, version 5, contains five data files for public use: surveys with full follow-up for 11 years (n=1,835,072), surveys centered around 1983 with full follow-up for 6 years (n=1,040,719), surveys centered around 1993 with full follow-up for 6 years (n=525,884), surveys centered around 2002 with full follow-up for 6 years (n=745,162) and a tobacco use consisting of supplemental tobacco use information collected periodically between 1993 and 2005 with 5 years of follow-up for mortality (n=493,282)."
"PRHHP","Puerto Rico Heart Health Program (PRHHP)","As Puerto Rico became more industrialized in the 1940s and 1950s, mortality rates for CHD increased. Since many factors related to CHD can be relatively homogenous within a population, two contrasting subgroups were selected for study in Puerto Rico: a rural population of men from a mountainous community and an urban population selected from San Juan. The NHLBI initiated the Puerto Rico Heart Health Program in May, 1965 as a prospective study of lifestyle, environmental and biological factors in the progression of cardiovascular disease in Puerto Rican men.","","Coronary Heart Disease, Coronary Disease","To investigate morbidity and mortality from CHD in Puerto Rican rural and urban men. The objectives of the study were: (1) to identify factors related to the development of CHD, (2) compare the etiology of disease in rural versus urban men, and (3) determine the prevalence and incidence of CHD and other cardiovascular diseases in Puerto Rican males.","A total of 9,824 (2,976 rural, 6,848 urban) men, age 45 to 64 were examined at the baseline exam."
"CSSCD","Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD)","Sickle cell disease is a single-gene defect that results in sickle-shaped red blood cells. Although the manifestations of sickle cell disease have been described, variations in the severity and number of manifestations, as well as interactions with other health events, leads to significant gaps in the understanding of the natural history of the disorder. For example, impairments to renal, cardiac, and pulmonary organ function are known to occur in sickle cell patients; however, the descriptions of these outcomes was generally retrospective in nature and occurred when organ damage was severe. In addition, only limited data existed on the social, economic, educational, vocational, and psychological adjustment of patients and families, and as with any chronic disease, impediments to sickle cell patients achieving their educational and vocational goals needs to be elucidated.","","Anemia, Sickle Cell, Blood Disease","The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease was initiated in 1977 to determine the natural history of sickle cell disease (SCD) from birth to death in order to identify those factors contributing to the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Specific objectives include: 1) to study the effect of sickle cell disease on growth and development from birth through adolescence 2) to study the conditions or events that may be related to the onset of painful crises 3) to obtain data on the nature, duration, and outcome of major complications of SCD 4) determine the nature, prevalence, and age- related incidence of organ damage due to SCD, and 5) study the role of SCD and its interaction with selected health events.

Phases 2 and 3 of the study involved followup of the infant cohort. A total of 709 infants (age less than 6 months) were enrolled during Phase 1 of the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), and Phases 2 and 3 of the CSSCD was designed to follow these children for an additional 10 years. The study objectives included: 1) define prospectively the natural history of sickle cell disease; 2) determine the relationships between cognitive and academic functioning and brain status as determined by MRI; 3) determine the cognitive or behavioral markers of silent infarct; 4) determine the relationship of family functioning on the Family Environment Scale (FES) to brain status, cognitive functioning, and social and demographic factors; 5) continue studies that will enhance the state of knowledge on the influence of sickle cell disease on the psychosocial adjustment of children and adolescents.

Phase 2A of the study sought to examine the progression of organ damage in the heart, lung, kidney and liver in adult cohort patients (born before 1/1/56) enrolled in phase 1 of the study between 3/79 and 5/81. A total of 620 patients from 11 centers were eligible for phase 2A.","CSSCD was a multicenter, prospective study on the natural history of sickle cell disease and participant enrollment into Phase 1 of the CSSCD began in 1978. Participant entry ended in 1981 for all patients greater than six months of age; however, infants continued to be enrolled until 1988. Both mild and hospital-based sickle cell patients were recruited. A total of 4,085 participants, ranging in age from newborns to adults, were enrolled in Phase 1 from 23 centers across the US. Data collection for phase 1 of the CSSCD ended in 1988.

For Phases 2 and 3, 450 were enrolled in the Phase 2 followup along with 17 children that were between 6 and 10 months of age at the time of Phase 1 enrollment. Phase 2 followup concluded in 1994 and 378 patients continued to be followed in the Phase 3 continuation. Data collection ended in 1998.

A total of 359 adult phase 1 participants were enrolled in phase 2A of the study between September of 1989 and July 1991. Exit visits began approximately 2 years later and were concluded in September of 1993."
"PPH Registry","Patient Registry for Primary Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH Registry)","There are several known causes of pulmonary hypertension: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congenital heart disease, mitral stenosis, left ventricular dysfunction and recurrent pulmonary emboli. Primary Pulmonary Hypertension is a disorder of unknown etiology which is diagnosed only after the known causes of pulmonary hypertension have been eliminated. Prior to the PPH registry, little was known regarding the epidemiology, etiology, natural history or ultimate survival among patients with PPH. In 1973, the WHO met to review the current state of knowledge on PPH and proposed the establishment of a multicenter collaborative study. The NHLBI PPH registry enrolled patients in the registry from 1981 to 1985.","There were 1.7 females for each male in the registry, and females tended to present with more severe symptoms. The mean time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 2 years. Right ventricular hypertrophy was found in 87% of patients and right atrial pressure was elevated in 72% of patients. The estimated median survival was 2.8 years with single year survival rates of: 1 year, 68%; 3 years, 48%; and 5 years, 34%. (Ann Intern Med, 1987; 107:216-23, Ann Intern Med, 1991; 115:343-49).","Hypertension, Pulmonary, Lung Diseases","Establish a patient registry to evaluate the natural history, etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Specific aims included the characterization of the demographic, medical history, family history, physical and laboratory findings of patients at time of diagnosis, and to characterize the survival duration of patients by traits evaluated at diagnosis and by medical interventions.","Patients were enrolled into the registry from 32 medical centers throughout the US. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of >25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg with exercise at catheterization. The diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was only accepted after the following secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension had been exlcuded: pulmonary hypertension within the first year of life, congenital abnormalities of the heart, lungs, or diaphragm, pulmonary thromboembolic disease, diagnosis of sickle cell anemia, history of intravenous drug abuse, obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, arterial hypoxemia, collagen vascular disease, parasitic disease affecting the lungs, pulmonary artery or valve stenosis, or pulmonary venous hypertension. Baseline and follow-up data collected on patients include demographic characteristics, chest radiograph, pulmonary function tests, lung perfusion scan or pulmonary angiogram, intracardiac left-to-right shunt, pulmonary hemodynamics, as well as a history, physical findings and other laboratory measurements. Patients were followed for approximately 5 years."
"WISE","Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE)","Women tend to have a higher prevalence of chest pain than men, yet a lower prevalence of epicardial coronary stenoses, and diagnostic tests such as exercise-induced ECG changes tend to have a higher false-positive rate in women than in men. Thus, accurate diagnosis of ischemic heart disease in women is a major challenge to physicians. In addition, prognosis in women with abnormal diagnostic tests is largely unknown and the role reproductive hormones play in this diagnostic uncertainty is unexplored. Moreover, the significance and pathophysiology of ischemia in the absence of significant epicardial coronary stenoses is unknown.","Among women without CAD, abnormal Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) consistent with myocardial ischemia predicted cardiovascular outcome, notably higher rates of anginal hospitalization, repeat catherization, and greater treatment costs (Circulation 2004; 109:2993-9).","Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Ischemia, Heart Diseases, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Disease","This is a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute sponsored, four-center study designed to: 1) optimize symptom evaluation and diagnostic testing for ischemic heart disease; 2) explore mechanisms for symptoms and myocardial ischemia in the absence of epicardial coronary artery stenoses, and 3) evaluate the influence of reproductive hormones on symptoms and diagnostic test response.","In Phase I (1996-1997), a pilot phase, 256 women were studied. During Phase II (1997-1999) angiographic and baseline data were collected on an additional 680 women to bring total enrollment to 936. Baseline data was also collected on a reference population of 70 women. Women eligible for participation are greater than 18 years of age, are undergoing a clinically indicated angiogram as part of regular medical care for chest pain or suspected myocardial ischemia. Exclusion criteria included comorbidity that would compromise one-year followup, pregnancy, contraindications to diagnostic testing, cardiomyopathy, NYHA class IV congestive heart failure, congenital heart disease, or significant valvular disease."
"AADR","Alpha1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Registry (AADR)","A hereditary disorder, patients with low serum levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin are at an increased risk for the early onset of emphysema. The only approved treatment for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is augmentation therapy using a purified preparation of human alpha-1-antitryspin. Sample sizes for a randomized controlled clinical trial of augmentation therapy were determined to be infeasible; therefore, a multi-center registry was initiated in 1988 to explore the natural history of the disease and the relative efficacy of augmentation therapy in patients with a severe deficiency of alpha-1-antitrypsin.","Subjects receiving augmentation therapy had decreased mortality risk during follow-up. FEV1 decline among all subjects did not differ by augmentation therapy; however, among subjects with FEV1 35-49% predicted, FEV1 decline was significantly slower for subjects on augmentation therapy than for those not receiving therapy. (Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 1998; 158:49-59)","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, Lung Diseases, Emphysema","To characterize the clinical and laboratory course of patients with severe alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency whether or not the patient is undergoing long-term augmentation therapy.","Eligible subjects included individuals 18 years of age or greater for whom the Central Laboratory confirmed that the serum alpha 1-antitrypsin level is < 11 rnicromolar, or a ZZ genotype confirmed by DNA gene-probe analysis. Individuals with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency were accepted into the Registry independent of status of augmentation therapy. However, if the individual was receiving therapy, the serum alpha 1-antitrypsin phenotype and level in the absence of therapy were confirmed by the Central Laboratory. A total of 1,129 subjects were enrolled from 37 clinical centers between March 1989 and October 1992. Follow-up continued through April 1996."
"REDS-HTLV","Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) HTLV Cohort (HTLV)","Previous evidence suggested that human T-lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) infection is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial infections.","The data support an increased incidence of infectious diseases among otherwise healthy HTLV-II and HTLV-I infected subjects. They are also consistent with the lymphoproliferative effects of HTLV-I, and with neuropathic effects of HTLV-I and HTLV-II. (Arch Intern Med. 1999;159:1485-1491)","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, Blood Donors, Blood Transfusion, Retroviridae Infections, HIV-1, HIV-2, HIV Infections, HTLV-I, HTLV-II","To conduct a longitudinal, multicenter epidemiologic study of the human retroviruses HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-I, and HTLV-II in volunteer blood donors from areas of the United States that were reportedly at high and medium or low risk for HIV.","The study includes 154 HTLV-I infected, 387 HTLV-II infected and 799 uninfected blood donors, all of whom were HIV type 1 seronegative at enrollment. Of the 1340 present and former blood donors examined at enrollment, 1213 (90.5%) were re-examined after approximately 2 years, including 136 HTLV-I and 337 HTLV-II seropositive subjects and 740 demographically stratified HTLV-seronegative subjects."
"MESA","Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)","Prospective epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have traditionally relied on the occurrence of clinically overt events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease death, to identify factors predicting development of disease. This design has served well to identify many CVD risk factors, but more recent study designs utilizing earlier, subclinical endpoints hold promise for furthering our capacity to predict and prevent CVD.","","Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Myocardial Infarction, Heart Diseases, Atherosclerosis, Heart Failure, Cardiovascular Diseases, Stroke, Hypertension, Coronary Artery Disease, Coronary Disease","This project investigated the prevalence, correlates, and progression of subclinical CVD and risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt CVD, and that predict progression of subclinical disease itself, in a population-based sample of 6,800 ethnically diverse men and women.","The cohort is a population-based sample of 6,800 men and women aged 45-84 years. The participants were selected from six US field centers. Approximately 38% of the cohort is White, 28% African-American, 23% Hispanic, and 11% Asian (of Chinese descent)."
"ARDSNet-ARMA/KARMA/LARMA","Acute Respiratory Distress Network (ARDSNet) Studies 01 and 03 Lower versus higher tidal volume, ketoconazole treatment and lisofylline treatment (ARMA/KARMA/LARMA)","Patients suffering from ARDS are extremely ill, require mechanical ventilation and, despite improvements in medical care and technology, had a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. An excessive inflammatory response is characteristic of ALI of which ARDS represents the most severe end of the pathophysiologic spectrum. The inflammatory response includes increased numbers of neutrophils activated to produce cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen intermediates. Pulmonary injury may also be enhanced by alveolar and tissue macrophages as a producer of vasoactive substances, neutrophil chemoattractants, and procoagulant substances. Ketoconazole, a synthetic antifungal imidazole, also has anti-inflammatory activities and may inhibit neutrophil recruitment via several different pathways known to be involved in the development of ALI and ARDS. Lisofylline causes a marked decrease in the circulating levels of the major oxidizable species of free fatty acids and also inhibits proinflammatory intracellular signaling. Mechanical ventilation in patients with ALI and ARDS have traditionally used tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight. These large tidal volumes are often necessary to achieve normal partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH, but may induce inflammatory responses through disruption of pulmonary epithelium and endothelium. Mechanical ventilation at lower tidal volumes may reduce injurious lung stretch and decrease the inflammatory response.","Ketoconazole was found to be safe but did not reduce mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or improve lung function. Lisofylline was also found to be safe and to have no beneficial effect for patients with ALI or ARDS. Ventilation at lower tidal volumes resulted in reduced mortality and an increase in the number of days without ventilator support.

Higher PEEP levels may improve oxygenation and reduce ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause circulatory depression and lung injury from overdistention. PEEP levels higher than traditional levels may reduce ventilator-induced lung injury by decreasing the proportion of nonaerated lung and higher PEEP levels may allow arterial-oxygenation goals to be met at a lower level of inspired oxygen (FiO2).","Patients with acute lung injury and ARDS who receive mechanical ventilation with a tidal-volume goal of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an end-inspiratory plateau-pressure limit of 30 cm of water, clinical outcomes were statistically similar whether lower or higher PEEP levels are used.

"AVID","Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID)","Sudden cardiac death is believed to account for a substantial portion of deaths with evidence of cardiovascular disease. The majority of sudden cardiac deaths are thought to be due to ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia. Currently the most common approach to preventing sudden cardiac death has been using drugs that suppress ventricular ectopy. However, given the disappointing results of most pharmacologic approaches to preventing sudden death, many investigators have turned to non-pharmacologic approaches such as surgery (endocardial resection, stellate ganglionectomy) or the implantation of devices that recognize VT or VF and deliver a shock. The greatest interest has been generated by work on the implantable cardiac defibrillator.","","Death, Sudden, Cardiac, Arrhythmia, Heart Diseases, Cardiovascular Diseases, Tachycardia, Ventricular, Ventricular Fibrillation","To evaluate if use of an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) results in reduction in total mortality, when compared with conventional pharmacological therapy, in patients resuscitated from sudden cardiac death who are otherwise at very high risk of mortality from arrhythmic causes.","The study was designed in two phases.

The rate of death or myocardial infarction was 12.1 percent in the angina-guided strategy, 8.8 percent in the ischemia-guided strategy, and 4.7 percent in the revascularization strategy.

"CAST","Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST)","A significant risk factor for mortality in post-MI patients is the presence of ventricular premature depolarizations. Although some anti-arrhythmic drugs, such as acute intravenous and long term beta blockers, had been shown to reduce mortality, it was unclear if arrhythmia suppression led to prolonged survival or if other effects contributed to the decreased mortality. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study was initiated in 1982 to assess the feasibility of identifying post-MI patients with ventricular arrhythmia and whether one or more drugs could be found to effectively and safely reduce ventricular premature depolarizations. The pilot study evaluated four active drugs (Encainide, Ethmozine, Flecainide, Imipramine) against placebo in 500 patients. Based on the results of the pilot study a full scale trial began enrolling patients in 1987.","After less than one year of followup the Encainide and Flecainide arms of the trial were stopped due to increased mortality and nonfatal cardiac arrests compared to placebo.

"ACRN-CIMA","Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) Colchicine In Moderate Asthma (CIMA)","Population studies indicate that the majority of asthmatics have mild to moderate disease requiring use of medications for control of symptoms. A significant but unknown fraction of these patients use inhaled corticosteroids for control. Although regular use of inhaled steroids is now considered standard therapy for such patients, the risks of long term use of such agents are unknown, especially in younger individuals still in growth stages of development and in post-menopausal women who are at risk for accelerated bone density loss. If colchicine furnishes an additional measure of control without side effects to patients on chronic inhaled steroid therapy, it may have a significant impact on asthma morbidity in a large number of patients. Such a finding would warrant further investigation of colchicine's efficacy in patients with severe asthma who, despite chronic oral corticosteroid therapy, continue to experience considerable disability, frequent hospitalizations, and significant morbidity from the disease as well as its treatment. If colchicine maintains control during inhaled steroid withdrawal, it will represent a useful alternative to inhaled steroids with cost advantages as well as possible advantages in terms of toxicity with long term therapy.","","Asthma, Lung Diseases","Because colchicine is an anti-inflammatory agent, an examination of its potential efficacy in asthma is best carried out in a population of subjects whose disease is thought to have a significant and yet remediable chronic inflammatory component. Unfortunately, there is no specific test that identifies such patients. However, it is reasonable to assume that patients who use inhaled corticosteroids for control of symptoms and lung function are suitable for such a study. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: In patients with moderate asthma who use inhaled corticosteroids for control of symptoms and lung function, colchicine provides therapeutic benefit as measured by maintenance of control when inhaled steroids are discontinued.","This trial will examine the safety and efficacy of oral colchicine in 70 patients with asthma of moderate severity who use inhaled corticosteroids for control of symptoms. For entry, patients must use 336 mcgs daily but not more than 1600 mcg daily of any inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide, beclomethasone dipropionate, or fluonisolide) for symptom control.

"AMIS","Aspirin-Myocardial Infarction Study (AMIS)","There was preliminary evidence that regular administration of aspirin may be of benefit to patients with known coronary heart disease. In addition, there was considerable evidence that platelet aggregation and platelet-induced thrombosis may play a role in several clinical events associated with coronary heart disease. Aspirin can inhibit the formation of prostaglandin endoperoxides and thromboxane A, which aggregate platelets and induce vasospasm, but the clinical pharmacology of the drug is further complicated by recent findings that it also blocks the synthesis of prostacyclin, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and a vasodilator that is produced in blood vessles.

"AFFIRM","Atrial Fibrillation Follow-Up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM)","Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is largely a disease of aging. Approximately half of AF patients are 75 years of age or more, and roughly 10% of persons 80+ years of age have AF. Atrial Fibrillation is also regarded as a strong risk factor for Stroke, particularly among the elderly. As many as 30% of strokes in persons 80+ years of age also present with AF. The initial therapy for AF is often management of sinus rhythm by antiarrhythmic drugs and cardioversion. However, antiarrhythmic drugs can have serious adverse effects and are often not effective in preventing the recurrence of AF. An alternative strategy is to control the ventricular response rate of AF with the use of atrioventricular nodal blocking agents or ablation of the atrioventricular junction and pacemaker implantation. The potential advantages of a response rate control approach is the use of less toxic drugs and a simplified therapy, although anticoagulation may be more important in a response rate therapy. Thus, the need arises to more clearly understand the implications of differing management strategies in the treatment of AF.","Neither strategy offered a statistically significant survival benefit compared to the alternative strategy (p=0.08, with rate-control having a slight survival advantage). The rates of the composite endpoint were also similar in the two strategies (p=0.33).

The randomized component sought to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of surgical versus medical interventions in patients with a reduced ejection fraction and significant coronary artery disease.","Patients less than 65 years of age with at least one clinical manifestation of heart disease (angina pectoris or MI) were eligible for the randomized trial if the left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than 35%, had evidence of anatomically significant coronary artery disease, the coronary artery to be bypassed supplied a viable myocardium, and at least three weeks had passed since the last myocardial infarction. The CASS registry consisted of 24,959 patients of which 2,099 were selected for potential randomization. A total 780 patients were randomized into the two arms of the trial and the remaining 1,319 patients that were medically eligible, yet non-randomized were followed for assessment of endpoints along with the randomized patients. Primary endpoints included death and myocardial infarction, and secondary endpoints included evaluation of angina and quality of life.

"DASH-Sodium","Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension - Sodium Study (DASH-Sodium)","Blood pressure is an established risk factor for stroke and heart disease, and research has shown this risk to increase across the full range of blood pressure levels. The DASH study established that a diet emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish and low-fat dairy products can reduce systolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mm Hg. Coupling the DASH diet with reduced sodium intake may potentially reduce blood pressure levels even further. Approximately 48% of adults have blood pressure above optimum levels, but below stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure 120-159 mm Hg or diastolic pressure 80-95 mm Hg), and the DASH diet along with reduced sodium intake could provide suitable levels of control for a large segment of the population. To examine the effect of the DASH diet along with reduced sodium intake on blood pressure, two dietary patterns (a control diet typical of what many Americans consume and the DASH diet) were compared at three levels of sodium intake: (1) higher level comparable to current US intake, (2) an intermediate level which mirrors the upper limit of current recommendations, and (3) a lower intake which could lower blood pressure even more.","Compared to the higher sodium control diet, the DASH diet reduced systolic blood pressure by an average of 5.9, 7.2, and 8.9 mm Hg for the higher, intermediate and lower sodium intakes respectively. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 2.9, 3.5, and 4.5 mm Hg for the higher, intermediate, and lower sodium intake levels. Reducing sodium intake in the control diet from higher to intermediate levels reduced systolic blood pressure by an average of 2.1 mm Hg and by 6.7 mm Hg to the lower sodium intake. Reducing sodium intakes to the lower level resulted in significantly lower systolic blood pressure in all sex, race, and hypertension status subgroups with the exception of non-black participants without hypertension. (N Engl J Med 2001;344:3-10).","Heart Diseases, Vascular Diseases, Hypertension, Cardiovascular Diseases","The primary objective of the DASH-Sodium Trial was to test the effects of two dietary patterns and three sodium intake levels on blood pressure in adult men and women with blood pressure higher than optimal or at stage 1 hypertension (systolic 120-159 mm Hg and diastolic 80-95 mm Hg).",""
"DISC","Dietary Intervention Study in Children (DISC)","A growing body of evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is a long term process that may begin early in childhood. Autopsy studies have revealed coronary fatty streaks in obese children, and other studies have shown that blood cholesterol levels show a fairly high correlation as children age into young adults. Familial clustering of lipid levels provide further rationale for intervention studies aimed at reducing cholesterol levels in children. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of dietary interventions in adults in reducing blood cholesterol levels; however, the safety and efficacy of dietary interventions in growing children were less clear, and previous studies were only short-term interventions.","After three years of followup, LDL cholesterol decreased by an average of 15.4 mg/dL in the intervention group and 11.9 mg/dL in the usual care group. This difference of 3.3 mg/dL (adjusted for baseline levels and gender) was significant (p=0.02). There were no significant differences between the two groups in adjusted mean height or serum ferritin. There were no significant differences in secondary safety measures as well. (JAMA, 1995; 273(18):1429-35). After 7 years of followup, the difference in LDL-cholesterol between the two treatment groups decreased to 2.0 mg/dL, which was no longer significant. There continued to be no significant differences in an adverse direction in primary or secondary safety measures. (Pediatrics, 2001;107(2):256-264).","Heart Diseases, Hypercholesterolemia, Cardiovascular Diseases","The Dietary Intervention Study in Children (DISC) trial was initiated in 1987 and sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a lipid lowering diet in 8 to 10 year old children after at least 3 years of followup. The primary efficacy outcome was low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary efficacy outcomes were total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol, and triglycerides. Primary safety outcomes were height and serum ferritin. Secondary safety outcomes included serum zinc, folate, retinol, and albumin. The trial was extended, with continuation of the intervention, albeit at a diminished intensity, to follow the children for an additional 4 years, resulting in a mean of 7.4 years of total follow-up, when the participants were on average 17 years old.","The DISC study was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 663 prepubertal children aged 8 to 10 years who had elevated LDL-cholesterol levels (80th-98th percentile based on age-gender distributions from the Lipid Research Clinics). The children were assigned at random to an intervention or usual care group. Fifty-five percent of the participants were male. The intervention group attended a series of group and individual sessions where the children and their families were counseled to follow a diet containing 28 percent of calories as total fat, less than 8 percent of calories from saturated fat, dietary cholesterol intake less than 75 mg/1000 kcal, and up to 9% of calories from polyunsaturated fat. The diets were designed to meet nutritional requirements of growing children. The usual care group was provided a packet of educational publications on heart-healthy eating that were generally available to the public. The primary endpoint was change in LDL-cholesterol after three years of followup, and subsequently after 7 years of follow-up."
"HIFI","High Frequency Ventilation in Premature Infants (HIFI)","With the introduction of mechanical ventilation in preterm infants, mortality and morbidity significantly improved but remained high. The improvement in survival that accompanied the use of mechanical ventilation also brought about an increase in the incidence of pulmonary complications. The principal complication occurs in the form of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Barotrauma and oxygen toxicity are considered to be in the pathogenesis for this disorder. Considerable interest in high frequency ventilation for preterm infants was generated when animal studies indicated high frequency ventilation to be effective in promoting gas exchange without apparent adverse effects. High Frequency Ventilation (HFV) delivers small tidal volumes at high frequencies of 4 to 15 Hz, and animal studies had indicated that HFV was associated with effective gas exchange, less barotrauma, and lower mean airway pressure. However, the efficacy and safety of HFV in preterm infants had not been studied. The HIFI Planning Phase was initiated in August 1984, and recruitment and intervention began in February 1986. Follow-up studies continued thru September 1988.","Bronchopulmonary dysplasia incidence was similar in the two groups as was mortality and the need for ventilatory support during the first 28 days. There was a significantly greater rate of pneumoperitoneum of pulmonary origin in the high frequency group as was a greater incidence rate of intracranial hemorrhage. (NEJM, 1989; 320:88-93)","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Lung Diseases, Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia","To evaluate the hypothesis that high frequency oscillatory ventilation in preterm infants would reduce the incidence of mortality and pulmonary complications compared to conventional mechanical ventilation.","Infants were eligible if they weighed between 750 and 2000 grams at birth, had respiratory failure in the first 24 hours of life, and had been treated with conventional mechanical ventilation for less than 12 hours prior to randomization. Infants weighing between 750 and 1250 grams were eligible independently of their respiratory failure while infants weighing between 1250 and 2000 grams were eligible only if they had severe lung disease. Infants were excluded if they had any of the following: meconium aspiration, neuromuscular conditions affecting respiration, hydrops fetalis, congenital heart disease, except for patent ductus arteriosus, major malformations, diaphragmatic hernia, hydroplastic lungs, or multiple births of three or more infants. The endpoints of the study included incident bronchopulmonary dysplasia, need for ventilatory support at 72 hours and 28 days postnatal age, crossover between the two arms, and mortality prior to the postnatal 28th day. A total of 685 infants were randomized into the study. Treatment could not be initiated in 12 infants due to early mortality or withdrawal of parental consent, therefore a total of 673 infants were enrolled."
"HDFP","Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program (HDFP)","Several studies have indentified elevated arterial blood pressure as a prominent risk factor for morbidity and mortality from all causes in general, and cardiovascular disease in particular. However, they were not designed to determine whether reduction of blood pressure was accompanied by reduction of disease and death.","The systematic effective management of hypertension has a great potential for reducing mortality for the large numbers of people with high BP in the population, including those with mild hypertension (JAMA 1979; 242:2562-2571).","Heart Diseases, Vascular Diseases, Hypertension, Cardiovascular Diseases","This program was designed to test the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in reducing all-cause mortality in a population-based study.","A population-based screening in 14 communities recruited 10,940 hypertensive participants, aged 30-69. They were randomly assigned to Stepped Care or Referred Care groups within each center by entry diastolic blood pressure."
"LHS","Lung Health Study (LHS)","","Participants in the two smoking intervention groups showed significantly smaller declines in FEV1 than did those in the control group. Most of this difference occurred during the first year following entry into the study and was attributable to smoking cessation, with those who achieved sustained smoking cessation experiencing the largest benefit. The small noncumulative benefit associated with use of the active bronchodilator vanished after the bronchodilator was discontinued at the end of the study. The authors concluded that an aggressive smoking intervention program significantly reduced the age-related decline in FEV1 in middle-aged smokers with mild airways obstruction. Use of an inhaled anticholinergic bronchodilator resulted in a relatively small improvement in FEV1 that appeared to be reversed after the drug was discontinued. Use of the bronchodilator did not influence the long-term decline of FEV1. Additionally, the study showed that lung function decline in the patients treated with the inhaled corticosteroid was statistically no different from that in the placebo group. Corticosteroid use did, however, result in 25 percent fewer respiratory symptoms and nearly 50 percent fewer outpatient visits for respiratory problems. However, after three years, bone density in the hip and back was lower in the corticosteroid group.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Lung Diseases, Lung Diseases, Obstructive","To determine the effects of Special Care, compared to Usual Care, on rate of decline in pulmonary function in a group of cigarette smokers identified as having mild abnormalities in pulmonary function. In addition, the study sought to determine if participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who were assigned to inhaled corticosteroids had a lower rate of decline in lung function and lower incidence of respiratory morbidity compared to participants assigned to placebo. Also, the study sought to determine the long-term effects of smoking cessation and continued smoking, on cardiopulmonary morbidity, mortality, and the rate of decline in the one second forced expiratory volume in men and women with early chronic obstructive lung disease who have been followed prospectively for 12 to 15 years.","Men and women who were cigarette smokers and between the ages of 35 and 60."
"MAGIC","Magnesium in Coronaries (MAGIC)","Mortality rate from ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains high in elderly patients and in patients who are not eligible for reperfusion therapy. Intravenous magnesium is a promising adjunctive treatment that may reduce reperfusion injury. Several earlier trials demonstrated a mortality rate reduction with magnesium treatment, but one large trial found no benefit. If magnesium proves beneficial, its use will provide a simple, cost-effective means to improve survival in this large patient population.","Early administration of magnesium in high-risk patients with STEMI had no effect on 30-day mortality. There was no indication for the routine administration of magnesium in patients with STEMI (LANCET 2002; 360: 1189-1196).","Myocardial Infarction, Heart Diseases, Myocardial Ischemia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Disease","To determine whether early intravenous magnesium treatment of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction reduces mortality.","Magnesium in Coronaries (MAGIC) is a large, simple trial designed to maximize the potential treatment effect of magnesium. A total of 6,213 high-risk patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to early treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate or matching placebo.

Information on the need for treatment of shock and sustained ventricular arrhythmias were collected to investigate the mechanisms by which magnesium might exert a beneficial effect."
"MRFIT","Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial for the Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease (MRFIT)","Prospective cohort studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, had established hypertension, cholesterol, and cigarette smoking as potentially modifiable risk factors for the development of coronary heart disease. A Task Force convened in 1970 determined that a multifactor intervention trial, similar to the approach a physician would utilize, was needed to ascertain whether behavior modification targeting multiple risk factors could potentially reduce mortality from coronary heart disease. A series of screening visits beginning in November of 1973 was used to establish eligibility for the trial. At the first screening visit, blood pressure, cigarette smoking history and cholesterol measurements were obtained to establish risk for CHD. Men were excluded from additional screens if their risk for CHD was low, had diabetes mellitus requiring medication, history of heart attack, serum cholesterol of 350 mg/dL or more, or diastolic pressure of 115 mmHg or more. Measurements taken at the second screen included a resting ECG, medical history, fasting blood draw, and glucose tolerance test. Men were excluded at the second screen based on an ECG determined prior MI, body weight greater than 150% of desirable, angina by Rose questionnaire, untreated symptomatic diabetes, a diet incompatible with the MRFIT food pattern, or lipid lowering treatment. Additional measurements were taken at the third screen and men agreeing to the trial were randomized into either a special intervention group or usual care.","After 6-8 years of followup, risk factor levels declined in both groups but slightly more in the special intervention group. Mortality from coronary heart disease and from all causes was not significantly different among the two groups. (JAMA, 1982; 248:1465-77)","Myocardial Ischemia, Heart Diseases, Coronary Disease, Cardiovascular Diseases","The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) sought to evaluate the effect of multiple risk factor intervention on mortality from coronary heart disease in high risk men.","A total of 12,866 men were randomized, roughly half into each group. The special intervention group was advised to follow an eating pattern designed to result in a nutrient intake of 30 percent to 35 percent of calories from fat, with 10 (later 8) percent from saturated and 10 percent from polyunsaturated fat; approximately 300 (later 250) mg of cholesterol; and modification of carbohydrates as needed for individual requirements. This group was also encouraged to cease cigarette smoking by a combination of techniques, including counseling and audio-visual aids. Hypertension management was based on a stepped-care program of weight reduction and drugs similar to that used in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program. Those in the usual care group were referred to their personal physician or other source of care for such management of their risk factors as considered appropriate by these providers. The primary endpoint was death due to coronary heart disease. Men in both the special intervention and usual care groups returned for assessment of changes in risk factor levels annually. The primary endpoint was mortality from coronary heart disease."

Effects on mortality, the magnitude and durability of benefits, and criteria for the selection of patients have not been established.","Overall, lung-volume-reduction surgery increases the chance of improved exercise capacity but does not confer a survival advantage over medical therapy. It does yield a survival advantage for patients with both predominantly upper-lobe emphysema and low base-line exercise capacity. Patients previously reported to be at high risk and those with non-upper-lobe emphysema and high base-line exercise capacity are poor candidates for lung-volume-reduction surgery, because of increased mortality and negligible functional gain.

"PIOPED","Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED)","In 1983, reliable data on the incidence of pulmonary embolism in the adult population and in groups identified at risk were not available because the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic procedures had not been determined. Estimates suggested there were about half a million episodes of pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients each year in the United States. Deaths attributable to pulmonary embolism would be expected in about one third of these patients if left untreated.","Almost all patients with pulmonary embolism had abnormal scans of high, intermediate, or low probability, but so did most without pulmonary embolism. Only in a minority of patients did the clinical assessment combined with the V/Q scan interpretation improve the overall chance of reaching a correct diagnosis of acute PE. Although a high probability scan usually indicated the presence of PE, only a small number of patients with PE had a high probability scan.

"RTS","Raynaud's Treatment Study (RTS)","Primary Raynaud's Phenomenon is a peripheral vascular disease of multiple etiologies. Patients with PRP experience episodes, or attacks of severe vasoconstriction. The extremities turn white or blue, often accompanied by numbness and pain which at times can be incapacitating. These attacks are often brought on by cold temperatures or stress. Treatment for PRP include management techniques for avoiding exposures to cold temperatures. In severe cases treatment may include use of vasodilators. Immediate release nifedipine has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks; however, side-effects also can be severe, inducing the patient to discontinue treatment. Sustained release nifedipine may be a more desirable alternative although the efficacy and adverse effects in patients with PRP has not been shown. Another alternative is non-pharmacological treatment involving temperature biofeedback. Temperature biofeedback uses voluntary control of blood flow and skin temperature, achieved by training, to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Temperature biofeedback may be a desirable alternative to vasodilators for patients with a preference for a non-drug treatment or have adverse reactions to vasodilators. Beginning in 1993, 313 patients were enrolled in the NHLBI sponsored, multicenter, Raynaud's Treatment Study and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: sustained-release nifedipine, matching pill placebo control, temperature biofeedback, or biofeedback control (frontalis muscle surface electromyographic biofeedback). Endpoints (verified attacks, all attacks) were collected during a 4 week period directly after a 2 month assessment and a 1 year assessment.","Nifedipine treated patients had a 66% reduction in verified attacks compared to placebo patients. There was no significant difference in temperature biofeedback compared to biofeedback control. Nifedipine patients tended to have fewer attacks than temperature biofeedback patients; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Sustained release nifedipine is a safe and effective treatment for PRP and may be superior to temperature biofeedback in reducing the frequency of attacks from PRP.

No evidence exists, however, to support their use as monotherapy in adults with persistent asthma. The SOCS trial was initiated to determine the efficacy of salmeterol therapy as a replacement for ICS therapy. The SLIC trial sought to determine if the addition of a long acting beta 2-agonist permitted a reduction in dose, and/or elimination of, inhaled corticosteroids over time.","The results indicate that in patients with persistent asthma suboptimally controlled by triamcinolone therapy alone but whose asthma symptoms improve after addition of salmeterol, a substantial reduction (50%) in triamcinolone dose can occur without a significant loss of asthma control.

Patients whose asthma was well-controlled at 4 weeks into the run-in period were randomized into the SOCS trial while patients whose asthma was not well-controlled were randomized into the SLIC trial. In the SOCS Study, one hundred sixty-four patients aged 12 through 65 years were randomized into one of three arms: 1) triamcinolone therapy, 2) salmeterol xinafoate, or 3) placebo. In the SLIC study, one hundred seventy-five patients aged 12 through 65 years initially continued the triamcinolone therapy. During a two-week salmeterol induction phase, 13 of every 15 patients received slameterol add-on therapy and two of every thirteen patients received placebo.

"SOLVD","Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD)","Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a major and increasingly recognized public health problem. The recognition that patients with CHF often have elevated peripheral vascular resistance has led to the introduction of vasodilator therapy, which has emerged as an important component of its treatment.

However, further clinical investigation were necessary to determine the most suitable thrombolytic agent dose and method of administration, the risk of subsequent reocclusion, restenosis, and/or myocardial infarction, the need for additional therapies, and the likelihood of benefit or hemorrhagic complications.","","Myocardial Infarction, Heart Diseases, Myocardial Ischemia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Disease","To assess whether intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) given in the early hours of acute myocardial infarction should be followed by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).","Patient entry began in April 1986 and ended in June 1988 with enrollment of 3,534 patients who had presented within 4 hours of the onset of chest pain thought to be caused by myocardial infarction.  Enrollment criteria were men and women between the ages of 18 and 75."
"TIMI III","Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia Trial III (TIMI III)","The myocardial ischemic syndromes, which account for a large portion of the annual mortality and morbidity from all causes in industrialized countries, encompass a wide clinical-pathologic spectrum. At one end of this spectrum are patients with chronic stable angina. When studied by coronary arteriography, such patients usually have obstructive atherosclerotic disease with no evidence of fresh thrombosis. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with acute MI who present with a discreet episode of prolonged chest pain accompanied by persistent ST segment elevation. Such patients have a high incidence of thrombotic coronary artery occlusion, and the early intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents has been shown to reestablish perfusion, limit the extent of left ventricular dysfunction, and reduce both early (in-hospital) and late (1-year) mortality in this group.","In a large study of unstable angina and non-Q wave myocardial infarction, the incidence of death and non-fatal infarction or reinfarction was low but not trivial after one year. An early invasive management strategy was associated with slightly more coronary angioplast procedures but equivalent numbers of bypass surgery procedures than a more conservative early strategy of catherization and revascularization only for signs of recurrent ischemia. The incidence of death or non-fatal infarction, or both, did not differ after one year by strategy assignment, but fewer patients in the early invasive strategy group underwent later repeat hospital admission. Either strategy is appropriate for patient management; differences in hospital admissions and revascularization procedures, with their attendant costs, are likely to be minimal.","Angina Pectoris, Myocardial Infarction, Heart Diseases, Myocardial Ischemia, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Disease","Investigate the role of a thrombotic agent added to conventional medical therapies and to compare an early invasive management strategy to a more conservative early strategy in patients with unstable angina and non-Q wave myocardial infarction.","1,473 men and women enrolled through 25 participating centers. Ages ranged from 21 to 79 years; however, patients 75 to 79 years old were eligible for only a brief period during enrollment. Patients were required to have chest discomfort at rest suggestive of myocardial ischemia, lasting greater than 5 minutes but less than 6 hours, that occurred within 24 hours of the time of enrollment."
"WAVE","Women's Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen Trial (WAVE)","Prior to the WAVE trial, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) and antioxidant vitamins were widely used for primary and secondary prevention in postmenopausal women with coronary disease, but clincal trials had not yet demonstrated benefit to support these therapies.","After a mean interval of 2.8 years, neither HRT nor antioxidant vitamin supplements provided cardiovascular benefit in postmenopausal women with coronary disease. Instead, a potential for harm was suggested with each treatment.(JAMA 2002; 288:2432-40)","Myocardial Ischemia, Heart Diseases, Postmenopause, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Arteriosclerosis, Coronary Disease","Determine the efficacy of estrogen replacement and antioxidant vitamins for preventing angiographic progression of coronary artery disease.","Seven clinical centers randomized 423 postmenopausal women with one or more angiographically documented coronary vessel stenosis of 15-75%. The study design was a double blind, 2X2 factorial consisting of active hormone replacement therapy or placebo and active vitamins E and C or their placebos. Randomization was stratified for clinical center and prior hysterectomy. Women in the active arm of the HRT treatment received either conjugated equine estrogen (prior history of hysterectomy) or conjugated equine estrogen and medroxypregesterone acetate (women with a uterus). Women assigned to the active arm of the vitamin therapy took two capsules daily of vitamin E and two tablets daily of vitamin C. The primary endpoint was mean change in minimum lumen diameter as determined by angiography."
"TOHP","Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP)","Phase I: As much as one-third of cardiovascular disease attributable to an above-optimal BP level occurs in the nonhypertensive portion of the distribution, providing impetus for directing prevention efforts at high normal levels of BP. Epidemiologic studies have identified several dietary and other factors related to lifestyle as possible determinants of BP levels. As of the mid-1980s, few trials had reported any results in subjects with BP levels in the nonhypertensive range, and almost none included long-term follow-up. The goals of Phase I of TOHP were to (1) test the short-term effect on BP of selected nutritional and behavioral interventions, and (2) to determine the feasibility of a long-term clinical trial of methods for reducing the incidence of hypertension.

Phase II: Between 30% and 40% of all BP-related CVD events occur in individuals with an average BP below currently defined hypertensive levels but above the optimal level. A large body of information from observational studies has identified several determinants of elevated BP. The corresponding interventional data are less plentiful and much of what is available reflects experience in small studies with relatively short periods of follow-up. The initial phase of TOHP (TOHP I) tested the feasibility and efficacy of 3 separate lifestyle interventions (weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, and stress management) and 4 separate nutritional supplement interventions (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and fish oil). The weight loss and sodium reduction groups, but not the other groups, demonstrated significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic BP. The second phase of TOHP was designed to test the effect of the two most promising interventions over a longer period of follow-up.","Phase I: The weight reduction intervention produced an average weight loss of 3.9 kg, a diastolic BP change of -2.3 mm Hg, and a systolic BP change of -2.9 mm Hg. The sodium reduction intervention lowered urinary sodium excretion by 44 mmol/24 h, diastolic BP by 0.9 mm Hg, and systolic BP by 1.7 mm Hg. Neither stress management nor nutritional supplements reduced diastolic BP significantly. The weight reduction and sodium reduction interventions were the most effective of those tested for reducing BP in normotensive persons (JAMA 1992;267:1213-20). The long-term effects of these require further evaluation.

Phase II: At six months, compared to usual care, BP decreased 3.7/2.7 mm Hg in the weight loss group, 2.9/1.6 mm Hg in the sodium reduction group, and 4.0/2.8 mm Hg in the combined group. At 36 months, BP decreases remained greater in the active intervention groups than in the usual care group (weight loss, 1.3/0.9 mm Hg; sodium reduction, 1.2/0.7 mm Hg; combined, 1.1/0.6 mm Hg). The incidence of hypertension was significantly less in each active intervention group than in the usual care group (Arch Intern Med 1997: 157:657-667). In overweight adults with high-normal BP, weight loss and reduction in sodium intake, individually and in combination, were effective in lowering systolic and diastolic BP, especially in the short-term. Although the effects on average BP declined over time, reductions in hypertension incidence were achieved.","Heart Diseases, Vascular Diseases, Hypertension, Cardiovascular Diseases","Phase I of TOHP (TOHP I) was designed to test the short-term feasibility and efficacy of seven nonpharmacologic interventions in persons with high normal BP. These interventions included the lifestyle interventions of weight loss, sodium reduction, and stress management, and the nutritional supplement interventions of calcium, magnesium, potassium and fish oil.

Phase II of TOHP (TOHP II) was designed to test the efficacy of interventions to promote weight loss, sodium reduction, and the combination of weight loss and sodium reduction in decreasing diastolic BP, systolic BP, and the incidence of hypertension during a 3- to 4-year follow-up period in moderately overweight men and women with a high-normal level of diastolic BP.","Phase I: Subjects were BP eligible if their mean diastolic BP averaged over the three screening visits with three measurements per visit was in the range 80-89 mmHg, and they had not taken antihypertensive medication within the past two months. The entry weight criterion for the weight loss intervention only was a BMI in the range 26.08 to 36.14 for men and 24.26 to 36.14 for women. Randomization began in September of 1987, and ended in October of 1988. Of the 2,182 randomized participants, the average age at randomization was 43 years, 70% were male, 82% were white, and 15% were black. Collection of final visit data occurred throughout 1989, and ended on January 12, 1990.

Phase II: Participants were 30-54 years of age, with a body mass index representing 110-165% of desirable body weight. BP was measured at each of 3 screening visits with 3 measurements per visit. Eligible subjects had an average diastolic BP in the range 83-89 mmHg, with systolic BP <140 mmHg, and were not on antihypertensive medication. A total of 2,382 participants were randomized into the trial. Average age at baseline was 44 years, 66% of participants were male, and 21% were minority."
"ACRN-DICE","Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) Dose of Inhaled Corticosteroids with Equisystemic Effects (DICE)","Inhaled corticosteriods (ICS) are being recommended for treatment of all ages of persistent asthma. The choice of an ICS is often based on convenience or cost factors. However, the potential for adverse systemic effects is not commonly considered. Becuase of these effects, it is important to be able to compare the different available prepareations and delivery systems with respect to both of their systemic effects and their efficacy, in order to determine an optimal asthma treatment strategy.","The ICS and placebo groups were comaparable at baseline with respect to sex, ethnicity, age, and BMI. the most reliable methods of evaluation was the 12-hour plasma cortisol under the curve (AUC) for the hourly overnight plasma cortisol measurements from 8 P.M. to 8 A.M.","Asthma, Lung Diseases","The goal of this study was to establish a reliable method to evaluate systemic bioavailability and to determine equisystemic effects (microgram dose producing equal systemic cortisol suppression) in inhaled corticosteriods (ICS).","156 corticosteriod-naive patients with asthmas were recruited as 6 ACRN centers.

"PAD","Public Access Defibrillation Community Trial (PAD)","Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-CA) remains a significant cause of death, in spite of recent declines in overall mortality from cardiovascular disease. Existing methods of emergency resuscitation are inadequate due to time delays inherent in transporting trained responders with defibrillation capabilities to the side of the OOH-CA victim.

Existing Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems typically combine paramedic Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) services with some level of community involvement, such as bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training. Some communities include automated external defibrillators (AEDs) at isolated sites or in mobile police or fire vehicles. Such an approach typically varies in effectiveness, with an incremental improvement in effectiveness seen in communities that organize and integrate services with the existing EMS system. However, optimal improvement in survival from sudden OOH-CA may require a program that utilizes volunteer non-medical responders (who may not have a traditional duty to respond to an emergency) trained to use AEDs.","Community units with volunteers trained in CPR and AEDs had significantly more patients surviving to hospital discharge than units with volunteers trained to use CPR only. There were 30 survivors among 128 definite cardiac arrests in the CPR+AED units and 15 survivors among 107 definite cardiac arrests in the CPR only units (p = 0.03). Serious adverse effects were rarely reported. No volunteers received inadvertent shocks, and no patients were shocked unnecessarily. AED maintenance problems were infrequent. A few participating volunteers reported severe stress related to responding to emergency situations. Although residential complexes represented 16% of the units and 29% of the treatable cardiac arrests, only 5% of the survivors were from residential complexes. Such information should be helpful for individual facilities that are considering implementing PAD programs. (NEJM 2004; 351:637-46).","Death, Sudden, Cardiac, Arrhythmia, Heart Arrest, Heart Diseases, Myocardial Infarction, Ventricular Fibrillation","The Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) Community Trial sought to evaluate broad implementation of Public Access Defibrillators (PAD) in urban community units. Survival to hospital discharge of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was the main outcome measure. Survival was compared in community units (e.g., apartment or office buildings, gated communities, sports venues, senior centers, shopping malls) served by non-medical responders trained in CPR and use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs), to units receiving the traditional optimum community standard of care (i.e., rescuers trained to recognize a cardiac emergency, call 911, and initiate CPR).","The PAD trial was a prospective, randomized community based trial. More than 19,000 volunteer responders from 993 community units in 24 North American regions participated. The two study arms had similar unit and volunteer characteristics. Patients with treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the two groups were similar in age (mean: 69.8 years), proportion of men (67 perecnt), rate of cardiac arrest in a public location (70 percent), and rate of witnessed cardiac arrest (72 percent)."

"HEIRS","Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study (HEIRS)","Hereditary iron overload, or hemochromatosis, is a common inherited disorder resulting from overabsorption of dietary iron. Excess iron is deposited in body tissues, and can accumulate to toxic levels over time causing damage in multiple organ systems. If untreated, these conditions may lead to death. Evidence suggests that early diagnosis and treatment can prevent disease manifestations and enable normal life expectancy. Thus, hemochromatosis may be suitable for detection and intervention through primary care screening strategies; however, much remains to be learned about the penetrance and expression of the known gene variants, HFE C282Y and H63D, associated with hemochromatosis. Iron overload and hereditary hemochromatosis have not been as extensively studied in racial/ethnic groups other than Caucasians.","Findings include: 1) transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (SF) mean levels differ across race/ethnic groups; 2) HFE C282Y variant does not account for these levels in non-Caucasians (Adams et al, NEJM 352:1769-78, 2005); and 3) there is similar participant acceptance for genotypic as for phenotypic testing (Anderson et al, Genet Med. 7:557-63, 2005).","Iron Overload, Blood Disease, Hemochromatosis","The HEIRS Study evaluated the prevalence and genetic and environmental determinants and potential clinical, personal, and societal impact of iron overload and hereditary hemochromatosis in a multi-center, multiethnic, primary care-based sample of adults.","The initial screen phase included 102,000 adults recruited over a 2-year period from 5 North American Field Centers (approx. 51% white, 24% African American, 11% Asian, 11% Hispanic, and 3% unidentified race; 63% are female and 37% are male)."

Even though adolescents are more active than adults, many do not engage in recommended levels of physical activity, and participation declines with age throughout adolescence, especially in girls (USDHHS, 1996; CDC, 1997). Fourteen percent of teenage girls get no regular exercise, twice the percentage as for boys. The proportion of adolescent girls who participate in regular vigorous physical activity declines dramatically each year they are in high school, from 61 percent among 9th graders to 41percent among 12th grade girls. In high school, enrollment for girls in daily physical education classes dropped from 41 percent in 1991 to 25 percent in 1995. Both the CDC report (1997) and the Surgeon General's Report (USDHHS, 1996) recommended the need for research testing the effectiveness of a coordinated school-based physical activity intervention linked to community agency programs to increase physical activity by adolescent girls.","A school-based, community-linked intervention modestly improved physical activity in girls.","Heart Diseases, Obesity, Cardiovascular Diseases","The purpose of the multicenter randomized trial was to test the effectiveness of a multicomponent school-based and community-linked intervention in preventing the decline in physical activity levels and cardiovascular fitness in middle school girls (i.e., in grades 6-8).","Middle school girls with English-speaking skills and no conditions to prevent participation in physical activity in 36 schools in six geographically diverse areas of the United States.

"PATHS","Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension Study (PATHS)","Numerous observational epidemiologic studies have established ethanol intake as one of the most important determinants of blood pressure levels. However, data from intervention studies were very limited.  The study was an inter-agency agreement involving the Veterans Administration and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Protocol development occurred between October 1988 and June 1989. The protocol was approved by the VA Cooperative Studies Evaluation Committee in July 1989 and reviewed by a separate Data and Safety Monitoring Board in September 1989.","The 1.3 drinks per day average difference between changes in self-reported alcohol intake observed in this trial produced only small nonsignificant effects on blood pressure. The results from the Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension Study (PATHS) do not provide strong support for reducing alcohol consumption in nondependent moderate drinkers as a sole method for the prevention or treatment of hypertension.","Heart Diseases, Vascular Diseases, Hypertension, Cardiovascular Diseases","To determine whether blood pressure is reduced for at least 6 months with an intervention to lower alcohol intake in moderate to heavy drinkers with above optimal to slightly elevated diastolic blood pressure, and whether reduction of alcohol intake can be maintained for 2 years.","Six hundred forty-one outpatient veterans with an average intake of 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day in the 6 months before entry into the study and with diastolic blood pressure 80 to 99 mm Hg were randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral alcohol reduction intervention program or a control observation group for 15 to 24 months. The goal of the intervention was the lower of 2 or fewer drinks daily or a 50% reduction in intake. A subgroup with hypertension was defined as having a diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 99 mm Hg, or 80 to 99 mm Hg if recently taking medication for hypertension."

The type and inflammatory activity of eicosanoids liberated during inflammation depends on the membrane phospholipid composition: omega 6 (n-6) fatty acid arachidonate yields highly reactive and inflammatory dienoic prostaglandins and series 4 leukotrienes, whereas omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids favor production of less active and potentially anti-inflammatory trienoic prostaglandins and series 5 leukotrienes. Patients at risk of developing ALI have n-3 levels approximately 25% of normal and those with established ALI have n-3 levels as low as 6% of normal, suggesting a potential role for n-3 dietary supplementation in patients with ALI.

Three randomized controlled studies, conducted in patients with ALI or sepsis-induced respiratory failure, demonstrated an association between the administration of an enteral formula enriched in n-3 fatty acids, GLA, and antioxidants and improved oxygenation and respiratory physiology compared with an unenriched, high-fat formula. However, interpretation of these results is limited by the small sample sizes and as-treated analyses of only those patients who tolerated full enteral nutrition.","The study was stopped by the DSMB for futility at the first interim analysis after 143 patients had been randomized to receive the n-3 supplement and 129 to receive the isocaloric control. Despite an 8-fold increase in plasma eicosapentaenoic acid levels, patients receiving the n-3 supplement had fewer ventilator-free days, intensive care unit–free days, and nonpulmonary organ failure-free days.

Specifically, patients had to be receiving mechanical ventilation, have a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 300 (adjusted if altitude exceeded 1000 m), and have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema on chest radiograph without clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension.

"ARDSNet-ALTA","Acute Respiratory Distress Network (ARDSNet) Studies 06 and 08 Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Trial of Aerosolized Albuterol Versus Placebo for the Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (ALTA)","In patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), inflammation of the pulmonary circulation increases vascular permeability. Fluid leaks from blood vessels into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli. Recovery from this form of acute respiratory failure requires that the pulmonary edema resolve. The resolution of alveolar edema is driven by active transport of sodium and chloride ions from the luminal space across both type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, creating an osmotic gradient for the reabsorption of water.  In the ex vivo human lung, the rate of alveolar fluid clearance can be doubled by treatment with a cyclic AMP beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.

On the basis of the preclinical observations that treatment with beta-2-agonists could reduce pulmonary edema and accelerate the rate of alveolar fluid clearance, the ALTA study was designed and undertaken with the hypothesis that treatment of patients with ALI/ARDS with beta-agonist therapy would accelerate the resolution of alveolar edema and improve clinical outcomes.","Ventilator-free days were not significantly different between the albuterol and placebo groups.  The results suggest that aerosolized albuterol does not improve clinical outcomes in patients with ALI. Routine use of beta-2 agonist therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with ALI cannot be recommended (Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2011; 184(5): 561-8).","Lung Diseases, ARDS, ALI, Acute Lung Injury, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult","This clinical trial was designed to test the hypothesis that an aerosolized beta-2-agonist, albuterol, would improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","282 ALI/ARDS patients that were intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema on frontal chest radiograph, had a ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 300 or less (adjusted for altitude as appropriate), and did not have clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension."
"ACRN-IMPACT","Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) IMProving Asthma Control Trial (IMPACT)","Treatment guidelines recommend daily antiinflammatory therapy to control mild persistent asthma. This recommendation for so-called controller therapy was prompted by studies reporting that such treatment improves physiological measures of airway obstruction (peak expiratory flow [PEF] and forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]), the severity of symptoms, the frequency of exacerbations, and the quality of life and was reinforced by reports that inhaled corticosteroid treatment may prevent progressive loss of pulmonary function. However, analysis of pharmacy records suggests that most patients infrequently renew their prescriptions for controller medications (inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene-receptor antagonists). We reasoned that patients with mild asthma may be using their treatment intermittently because they do not perceive the need for daily therapy. To analyze whether this strategy could be an acceptable approach to treatment in patients with mild persistent asthma, we modified a symptom-based action plan to guide the use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids when signs or symptoms of asthma worsened.","The three treatments produced similar increases in morning PEF (7.1 to 8.3 percent; approximately 32 liters per minute; P=0.90) and similar rates of asthma exacerbations (P=0.24), even though the intermittent-treatment group took budesonide, on average, for only 0.5 week of the year. As compared with intermittent therapy or daily zafirlukast therapy, daily budesonide therapy produced greater improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (P=0.005), bronchial reactivity (P<0.001), the percentage of eosinophils in sputum (P=0.007), exhaled nitric oxide levels (P=0.006), scores for asthma control (P<0.001), and the number of symptom-free days (P=0.03), but not in post-bronchodilator FEV1 (P=0.29) or in the quality of life (P=0.18). Daily zafirlukast therapy did not differ significantly from intermittent treatment in any outcome measured.

It may be possible to treat mild persistent asthma with short, intermittent courses of inhaled or oral corticosteroids taken when symptoms worsen. Further studies are required to determine whether this novel approach to treatment should be recommended.","Asthma, Lung Diseases","Although guidelines recommend daily therapy for patients with mild persistent asthma, prescription patterns suggest that most such patients use these so-called controller therapies intermittently. In patients with mild persistent asthma, we evaluated the efficacy of intermittent short-course corticosteroid treatment guided by a symptom-based action plan alone or in addition to daily treatment with either inhaled budesonide or oral zafirlukast over a one-year period.","Inclusion criteria were physician-diagnosed asthma, an age of 18 to 65 years, and an FEV1, measured more than four hours after the most recent use of a bronchodilator, that was at least 70 percent of the predicted value. All patients had an increase in the FEV1 of at least 12 percent and at least 200 ml after the inhalation of albuterol or a fall in FEV1 of at least 20 percent after inhaling a concentration of methacholine of less than 16 mg per milliliter (PC20; lower concentrations indicate greater reactivity)."
"ACRN-PRICE","Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) Predicting Response to Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy (PRICE)","Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the preferred anti-inflammatory therapy for the treatment of persistent asthma as recommended by both national and international guidelines. However, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated marked variability in response to ICS with 25% to 35% of subjects with asthma showing little improvement in FEV1 and/or bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Retrospective analysis of a previous Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) study identified elevated fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and greater bronchodilator reversibility to a short-acting β2-agonist as predictors of a positive FEV1 response to ICS and higher sputum eosinophils and shorter duration of asthma (years since diagnosis) as predictors of improvement in BHR.7 This study did not examine, however, whether these responses in pulmonary function to short-term ICS treatment could predict the long-term response in the maintenance of asthma control with more prolonged treatment. Thus, the ACRN embarked on a larger prospective study to analyze biomarkers and characteristics of asthma as predictors of response to short-term (6-week) ICS treatment and then to examine the relationship of the short-term response to the importance of continued ICS treatment for maintenance of asthma control over a longer time (16 additional weeks).","The short-term response to inhaled corticosteroids with regard to FEV1 improvement predicts long-term asthma control.","Asthma, Lung Diseases","To evaluate potential biomarkers of predicting short-term (6-week) response to inhaled corticosteroid with subsequent evaluation of responders and nonresponders to asthma control over a longer interval (16 additional weeks).","Inclusion criteria for study subjects were individuals with asthma between 18 and 55 years of age with a baseline FEV1 55% to 85% predicted and a methacholine PC20 ≤12 mg/mL.

Additional exclusion criteria regarding patient condition and compliance during the run-in period were applied."
"MSH","Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH)","Sickle cell anemia affects nearly one in every five hundred African-American newborns in the United States.  As of the early 1990’s there was no available effective treatment for patients with sickle cell anemia for the prevention or reduction of recurrent, vaso-occlusive (painful) crises.  There are an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 people in the United States with sickle cell anemia.  At least 10% (8,000 to 10,000) of adults with sickle cell disease have more than three crises per year, based on projections from the Study of the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD)., In 1948, Janet Watson observed that children with sickle cell anemia did not begin to develop symptoms until HbF levels had dropped to those seen in adults (at approximately 6 months of age). This was the first indication that HbF may interfere with HbS formation within the red cells. Supportive evidence was provided some years later by clinical descriptions of the asymptomatic compound heterozygous condition sickle cell/hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin and observations that patients with relatively mild sickle cell anemia in eastern Saudi Arabia and India tended to have higher HbF concentrations. Data from 3,578 American patients studied by the CSSCD show that HbF level is a significant predictor of pain rate, over the entire range of values encountered, without a threshold, leading to the hypothesis that increases in HbF would have beneficial clinical effects.","This controlled trial made hydroxyurea the first drug of proven benefit in the prevention of vaso-occlusive pain crisis and acute chest syndrome caused by sickle cell disease.  No significant side-effects of hydroxyurea therapy were noted.

The study found that adult patients taking hydroxyurea for frequent painful sickle cell episodes appear to have reduced mortality after 9 of years follow-up. Survival was related to HbF levels and frequency of vaso-occlusive events.","Anemia, Sickle Cell, Hematologic Diseases, Hemoglobinopathies","The primary objective of MSH was to determine whether or not treatment with hydroxyurea titrated to maximum tolerated doses would reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive (painful) crises by at least 50%.  The principal end point was the occurrence of a vaso-occlusive (painful) crisis,  defined as pain not due to another cause, lasting at least four hours and requiring parenteral (or equivalent doses of oral narcotics)) narcotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for relief.  Occurrences of chest syndrome were counted as crises.  Pain due to chronic conditions such as ankle ulcers, osteomyelitis or aseptic necrosis of bone was not counted as crises. The secondary objectives investigated the correlations of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and other patient or treatment characteristics with the occurrence of vaso-occlusive (painful) crises, and the effect of treatment on the quality of life.","The original MSH study cohort included 299 men and women between 18 and 50 years old with a diagnosis of sickle cell anemia by gel electrophoresis conducted by a Core Laboratory. Subjects were also required to have had at least 3 vaso-occlusive crises in the 12 months prior to enrollment, and were required to successfully complete a 2 week “run-in” period comprised of two visits with baseline blood sample collections, completion of a two week diary and daily ingestion of a folic acid tablet.  238 subjects from the original cohort were enrolled in the first 5 year observational study."
"TSS","Transfusion Safety Study (TSS)","In the early 1980’s there were reports of AIDS in patients with hemophilia and in others receiving blood transfusions.  The incidence of transfusion-acquired AIDS was so low as to preclude a general prospective study of transfusion recipients to determine the overall incidence of the disease. By focusing on patient groups that appeared to have a higher likelihood for developing AIDS because they required chronic, repeated transfusion therapy, information about the epidemiology of the disorder could be more readily obtained. Continuing medical evaluation of these patients from apparent high-risk groups in a prospective fashion allowed identification of significant emerging physiologic alterations and to follow the time-course of pathologic developments.","","Blood Transfusion, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, HIV Infections","To develop two donor-recipient repositories consisting of a serum repository from 200,000 donors in high AIDs prevalence areas of the United States and a plasma and cell repository from subjects consisting of blood donors, transfusion and other blood product recipients and control cohorts.  The purpose was to be able to determine the outcome of the transfusion of blood components whose donors would be excluded when screening tests for anti-HIV-1 infection became available.  A secondary consideration was to be able to determine the outcome of the transfusion of blood components from donors with positive tests for other viruses subsequently found to be of importance in transfusion medicine.","<u>Donor Serum Repository</u>   Subjects for the donor repository were recruited from persons who presented to make blood donations at study sites.

"REDS II-LAPS","Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II (REDS II) Leukocyte Antibodies Prevalence Study (LAPS)","Donor based risk reduction interventions for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) have been widely adopted in the United States and elsewhere in the past several years due to data indicating that TRALI has continued to be the leading cause of blood transfusion-related deaths in the US.  By the year 2009, most blood centers in the US were transfusing plasma supplied primarily by male or never pregnant female donors, and some centers were selectively screening multiparous female platelet and plasma apheresis donors for HLA antibody. Most transfused components containing HLA antibodies do not result in recipients developing TRALI. Although several prior studies assessed outcomes in recipients of previously donated components from HLA antibody positive donors who were implicated as causing TRALI in an index recipient, they had significant limitations. These limitations included the use of different methods for HLA antibody screening and for reviewing recipient outcome data and diagnosing TRALI. Also they had small sample sizes considering the low incidence of TRALI and most did not evaluate TRALI occurrence in recipients of control components using a blinded study design.","HLA antibodies were detected in 17.3% of all female donors and in 24.4% of those with a history of previous pregnancy. The prevalence of HLA antibodies increased in women with greater numbers of pregnancy: 1.7% (zero), 11.2% (one), 22.5% (two), 27.5% (three), and 32.2% (four or more pregnancies; p < 0.0001). The findings of increased prevalence with greater numbers of pregnancies were confirmed when data from single antigen bead testing (which was used to determine HLA antibody specificities) were analyzed. Transfused blood donors did not appear to have a significantly higher prevalence of HLA antibodies than their non-transfused counterparts; i.e., HLA antibodies were detectable at low prevalence (1.0 - 1.7%) in male donors regardless of transfusion history (p = 0.16). HNA antibody prevalence in a specially selected group of LAPS-I donors was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3 - 1.3%) with antibodies detected in female donors as well as in non-transfused male donors. Four of five HNA antibodies in females showed a definable HNA specificity whereas the HNA antibodies detected in three male donors were non-specific.

In LAPS-II it was determined that TRALI incidence was 0.59% (seven cases) in recipients of anti-HLA–positive components versus 0.16% (two cases) in control arm recipients for an odds ratio of 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.7-17.4; p = 0.10). Based on this trend of an increased incidence of TRALI in the study arm along with recent surveillance data from other sources, the data were consistent with the likelihood that TRALI risk is decreased by selecting high-volume plasma components for transfusion from donors at low risk of having HLA antibodies.","Blood Transfusion, Acute Lung Injury, Blood Donors","The Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study (LAPS-I) was designed to measure the prevalence of HLA and neutrophil antibodies in blood donors with or without a history of pregnancy or  blood transfusion and to develop a repository of blood samples from well characterized blood donors whose detailed pregnancy and transfusion  histories are known.

The Leukocyte Antibody Prevalence Study II (LAPS-II) was designed to evaluate a primary endpoint of combined incidence of TRALI and possible TRALI in study recipients of at least one HLA antibody -positive high-plasma-volume component received from a LAPS-I donor versus control recipients of at least one HLA antibody-negative high-plasma-volume component.","LAPS-I was a cross-sectional multicenter study conducted at six REDS-II blood centers: American Red Cross New England Region, Dedham, MA; the American Red Cross Southern Region, Atlanta, Georgia; the Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the Hoxworth Blood Center/University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio; the Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and the Blood Centers of the Pacific, San Francisco, California. Over a six month period (December 2006- May 2007), 7,900 adult whole-blood and apheresis donors were enrolled in the study. All blood donors age 18 and older at the selected sites were eligible for the study. Both male and female donors who were able to donate whole blood or apheresis products were enrolled in the study. Donors who tested reactive or positive in any of the infectious diseases donor screening tests were not eligible. The recruitment goals for enrollment of minority donor were consistent with the overall proportion of minority donors at each participating center.  

LAPS-II consisted of five of the LAPS-I centers (the American Red Cross New England Region, Dedham, MA did not participate). Each blood center recruited participating hospitals in its region. In total, 42 hospitals participated; these hospitals received approximately 50% of the high-plasma-volume components issued by the five blood centers (51% of transfusable plasma and 48% of plateletpheresis). The donor HLA antibody status was obtained from the LAPS-I study.  For blood donors, the inclusion criteria included those with HLA antibodies and some of the donors who did not have antibodies. Among donors without HLA antibodies, the selection was based on gender and parity frequency-matching at each REDS-II Center with the antibody positive donors. For transfusion recipients, recipients who received the study blood components at participating hospitals were included. Further record review was conducted on those recipients who were documented to have had a chest x-ray within 24 hours after the study transfusion."

"WLM","Weight Loss Maintenance (WLM)","Nearly two-thirds of US adults are overweight or obese and together overweight and obesity are the second leading cause of preventable death, primarily through effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes). Weight loss improves these risk factors, and evidence suggests that benefits persist as long as weight loss is maintained. Even with the potential for health benefits of sustained weight loss, there is little evidence, especially from clinical trials, on how to maintain weight loss. In fact, very few trials have explicitly tested alternative strategies to sustain weight loss, and few weight loss studies have implemented interventions for longer than 18 months. The Weight Loss Maintenance trial (WLM) tests strategies for sustaining weight loss after initial clinically significant weight loss has been achieved. WLM participants were a diverse population at high CVD risk, populations at highest risk of obesity-related consequences and therefore with the greatest potential to benefit from sustained weight loss.","The majority of individuals who successfully completed an initial behavioral weight loss program, lost at least 4 kg, and were randomized to phase 2 maintained a weight below their initial level. Monthly brief personal contact provided modest benefit in sustaining weight loss, whereas an interactive technology–based intervention provided early but transient benefit.","Heart Diseases, Obesity, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Non-insulin Dependent","To compare the long-term effects of two weight loss maintenance intervention groups, one receiving behavioral intervention through personal counseling and the other receiving behavioral intervention through web-based individually tailored interactive technology, versus a self-directed/usual care control group.","The two-phase trial included 1032 overweight or obese adults (38% African American, 63% women) from four clinical centers: Duke University, Johns Hopkins University, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, and the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research.

In the MHCS-II cohort of HCV-seropositive people with hemophilia and related coagulation disorders, the prevalence rates of ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and persistent jaundice were 2- to 3-fold higher with HIV-1, when adjusted for age and most could not be ascribed to HAART or other anti-HIV-1 regimens.

In the MHCS-II, 74% of the HIV-1-positive and 51% of the HIV-1-negative participants had evidence of current or previous HBV infection. In MHCS-I, the risk of decompensated end stage liver disease was increased 8.1-fold for carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 3.4-fold for the much larger group of hemophiliacs who had cleared HBsAg.","Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Liver Failure","The First Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study (MHCS-I) evaluated and prospectively followed patients with hemophilia or a related coagulation disorder.  Initiated in 1982, this study particularly sought to understand the cause and natural history of HIV infection and AIDS in this population which was at high risk for development of AIDS.

The Second Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study (MHCS-II) evaluated and prospectively followed a cohort of subjects with hemophilia who were exposed to hepatitis C virus (HCV). The primary objectives were to quantify the rates of liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and to evaluate candidate clinical, genetic, virologic, serologic and immunologic markers that are likely to be on the causal pathway for these conditions, identify predictive clinical and laboratory markers and follow the markers over time, identify host genes that confer susceptibility or resistance to HCV and HIV infections or to the diseases that result from these infections and to identify response and complication rates of various anti-HCV and anti-HIV regimens in the setting of comprehensive clinical care of persons with hemophilia.","Adults and children who had a congenital coagulation disorder [hemophilia A or B (congenital factor VIII or IX deficiency)] von Willebrand's disease, or other were enrolled from  8 collaborating hemophilia centers in the US between 1982 and 1985.  Four additional centers from the US and 4 centers from Europe joined the study between 1987 and 1990.

In MHCS-II, 52 collaborating hemophilia centers in North and South America and Europe, enrolled patients who had a congenital coagulation disorder [hemophilia A or B (congenital factor VIII or IX deficiency), von Willebrand's disease, or other], who had reached 13 years of age, and who had serological or molecular evidence of HCV or HIV-1 infection. The majority of subjects consisted of a ""HCV cohort"" of whom a portion was co-infected with HIV, the ""HIV cohort""."
"ACRN-SLiMSIT","Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) Salmeterol and Leukotriene Modifiers vs. Salmeterol and ICS Treatment (SLiMSIT)","Previous asthma studies suggest that the most robust clinical effect of LABAs, which is lung function, is distinct from that of the LTRAs, which provides protection against exacerbations. The efficacy of combination therapy of LTRAS and LABAs, as compared against the usual combination of LABAs and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), is unknown.","In patients with moderate asthma, the combination therapy of LTRAS and LABAs is inferior to the combination of ICS and LABA as judged by protection against asthma treatment failures, lung function, and markers of inflammation and airway reactivity. The researchers recommended that patients similar to those in the study should not substitute the combination therapy of LTRAS and LABAs for the ICS and LABA combination therapy.","Asthma","This randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study on subjects with moderate asthma, compares the clinical efficacy of regular treatment with the combination of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) montelukast and the long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) salmeterol to determine whether the combination montelukast and salmeterol could provide an effective therapeutic strategy for asthma.","The patients consisted of male and female, ages 12 to 65 years old, with a history of physician diagnosed asthma at the Asthma Clinical Research Network centers.  At enrollment, the subjects were required to have FEV1 ≥ 40% of the predicted value and demonstrate hyperresponsiveness to methacholine(PC20 ≤8 mg/ml) or a 12% or greater improvement in FEV1 after the administration of a β-agonist bronchodilator (if FEV1 was <55% of predicted at enrollment). Subjects not using an ICS or LTRA at the time of enrollment were required to have an FEV1 ≤ 80% of the predicted value. No smoking was allowed for 1 year before enrollment, and cumulative exposure was less than 10 pack-years. Subjects with respiratory tract infection, or asthma exacerbation (i.e., the need for oral corticosteroid or urgent care visit) within the previous 6 weeks were also excluded."
"BMT CTN-0102","Blood and Marrow Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) A Trial of Tandem Autologous Stem Cell Transplants +/- Post Second Autologous Transplant Maintenance Therapy Versus Single Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Followed by Matched Sibling Non-myeloablative Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant for Patients With Multiple Myeloma (0102)","High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) improves survival in multiple myeloma patients younger than 65 years compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, despite high remission rates and improved survival, there is continued risk of disease progression after a single or tandem autoHCT even in patients with “standard risk” myeloma. The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 0102 trial investigated several options to improve upon these results, including tandem autoHCT (auto-auto), post-transplant maintenance strategies, and allogeneic HCT (alloHCT). Preliminary studies suggested that planned sequential autoHCT improves responses and survival outcomes compared to single autoHCT. Furthermore, it was thought that maintenance therapy with thalidomide and corticosteroids after autoHCT further prolongs progression-free and overall survival.

AlloHCT, which provides a tumor-free graft, is an attractive alternative treatment approach as it offers potential additional disease control through a graft-versus-myeloma effect (GVM). Early studies of alloHCT with myeloablative conditioning regimens demonstrated a higher frequency of molecular remissions and lower rates of relapse compared to autoHCT, but overall benefits were offset by high treatment-related mortality (TRM). Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens on the other hand, are designed more for immunosuppression than cytoreduction. Furthermore, when used after an autoHCT for cytoreduction, AlloHCT with nonmyeloablative conditioning adds a potential for GVM with lower TRM.","Thal-Dex maintenance was associated with poor compliance and did not improve progression-free or overall survival. At three years there was no improvement in progression-free or overall survival with auto-allo compared to auto-auto transplantation in patients with standard risk myeloma.

Patients within the tandem autologous transplantation (auto-auto) arm were randomized to receive one years of maintenance therapy with thalidomide plus dexamethasone (Thal-Dex) or observation (Obs).","Patients were eligible for the trial if they were 70 years old or less, had Karnofsky scores of at least 70%, met Durie and Salmon criteria for diagnosis of multiple myeloma, had symptomatic multiple myeloma with no disease progression after the start of initial therapy, had received at least three cycles of systemic therapy, and were within 2-10 months of the start of the initial therapy.

"BMT CTN-0101","Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) Comparison of Fluconazole Versus Voriconazole to Treat Fungal Infections in Individuals Receiving Blood and Marrow Transplants (0101)","Allogeneic blood and marrow transplant patients are highly susceptible to invasive fungal infection prior to engraftment, due to neutropenia and mucosal injury. After engraftment, an impairment of cell mediated immunity from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the use of aggressive immunosuppressive therapies, such as corticosteroids, leave patients vulnerable to invasive fungal infections. Recipients of alternate donor transplants are especially susceptible due to slow reconstitution of cell mediated immunity.
Fluconazole prophylaxis in prospective randomized trials of both autologous and allogeneic transplant recipients has previously been demonstrated to reduce invasive fungal infections prior to engraftment (NEJM 326:845, 1992; Clin Inf Dis 28:331, 1999). A prolonged course of fluconazole given during the first 75 days (to cover the early post-engraftment period of risk) was highly effective in preventing yeast infections (J Inf Dis 171:1545, 1985). This translated into a survival benefit. An analysis of long-term outcomes of these individuals demonstrated a continuing benefit beyond the course of prophylaxis with a further benefit in survival (Blood 96:12055, 2000). In another study of various factors associated with survival after matched unrelated donor transplants, fluconazole prophylaxis was an independent predictor for overall survival in a multivariate analysis (NEJM 338:962, 1998). Fluconazole prophylaxis has been found to be effective and safe with few substantive drug interactions and has been widely adopted by transplant clinicians.","This study demonstrated that in the context of intensive monitoring and structured empiric antifungal therapy, 6-month fungal-free survival and overall survival did not differ in allogeneic HCT recipients given prophylactic fluconazole or voriconazole.","Leukemia, Lymphoma, Infection","The study is designed as a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, prospective, comparative study of fluconazole versus voriconazole for the prevention of fungal infections in allogeneic transplant recipients.","A total of 600 patients were randomized into the trial. Subjects were ≥ 2 years of age undergoing related or unrelated allogeneic HCT after myeloablative conditioning regimen for the treatment of a hematological malignancy. Patients were excluded if they had prior invasive yeast infection within 8 weeks of study entry, mold infection within 4 months of study entry, or a viral or bacterial infection not controlled at time of registration."
"BMT CTN-0201","Blood and Marrow Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) Comparing Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Versus Bone Marrow Transplantation in Individuals With Hematologic Cancers (0201)","Many studies of allogeneic marrow transplantation have shown that a higher dose of marrow cells correlates with a stronger hematopoietic engraftment and lower mortality from infectious complications. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) collected after mobilization with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) contain a large number of CD34-positive progenitors and total cells than bone marrow. These observations led to the hypothesis that transplantation of PBSC would lead to lower mortality compared to transplantation of marrow. However, some studies have also shown increased risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as compared to bone marrow.","There was no detected significant survival differences between peripheral-blood stem-cell and bone marrow transplantation from unrelated donors. Further analysis indicated that peripheral-blood stem cells may reduce the risk of graft failure, whereas bone marrow may reduce the risk of chronic GVHD.

Acute GVHD produces significant morbidity and complicates patient management resulting in organ toxicity, frequent infections, malnutrition, and substantial delay in recovery from transplantation. Corticosteroids have been the primary therapy for acute GVHD for over three decades. Various additional immunosuppressive strategies have been tested as GVHD therapy but neither anti-thymocyte globulin, CD5-immunotoxins, IL-1 antagonists nor other agents have proven effective  in either control of GVHD symptoms or improvement in survival. Published response rates of complete response (CR) to acute GVHD therapy with corticosteroids range from 25-41%. These rates were used as benchmarks for assessing efficacy of promising new agents. New immunosuppressive agents and strategies are required to improve the management of GVHD and decrease the toxicities of the immunosuppressive regimens. Thus the BMT CTN 0302 trial was initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of four new treatment agents, in combination with corticosteroids. The goal was to identify the most promising agent(s) to further evaluate in a definitive phase 3 trial.","In this randomized Phase II study, the cumulative incidence of CR by day 28 was greatest for patients randomized to MMF followed by denileukin, pentostatin, and etanercept. MMF patients also had the highest 9-month overall survival rates, and lowest cumulative incidences of severe infections.  Thus, MMF plus corticosteroids was identified as the most promising treatment combination for direct comparison with corticosteroids alone in a phase 3 study for initial acute GVHD therapy.

"REDS II-RISE","Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II (REDS II) Donor Iron Status Evaluation Study (RISE)","Previous studies have shown that regular blood donors are at risk of iron deficiency. Also, a polymorphism in transferrin, which increases the likelihood that menstruating women will be iron deficient, and several genes for hemochromatosis were described in other previous studies. Findings from these studies lead to the possibility that genetic markers might define “at-risk” and “protected” donor groups with respect to iron depletion in blood donors.  In addition, none of the previous donor studies had assessed the influence of racial/ethnic or socioeconomic factors, nor behavioral variables and dietary intake. Also, the availability of new tests of body iron status provided further opportunities to detect or prevent this problem.  For these reasons, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study – II (REDS-II) program conducted the REDS-II Donor Iron Status Evaluation (RISE) whereby blood donors were followed prospectively for 15-24 months to provide an in-depth and contemporary evaluation of iron status in a US blood donor population.","A large proportion of both female and male frequent blood donors have iron depletion. Strong associations between higher prior donation intensity and a shorter time since last donation and iron depletion were observed. Iron depletion also developed in a high proportion of returning FT/RA donors (51% of females and 20% of male had IDE on follow up). Other than donation intensity and time since last donation, gender, weight, age, and the use of self-administered iron supplements were found to be important independent predictors of AIS and/or IDE. Time since last red cell donation was a highly significant factor for hemoglobin deferral  as were black race, female gender and younger age in women. Reducing the frequency of blood donation is likely to reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency among blood donors, as might implementing routine iron supplementation.","Blood Transfusion, Blood Donors","The Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II (REDS-II) Donor Iron Status Evaluation Study (RISE) was designed to evaluate the effects of blood donation intensity on iron and hemoglobin (Hb) status, assess factors that could modify that relationship, and provide data to help formulate optimal whole blood donation frequency.","The RISE study was a longitudinal multi-center study conducted between 2007 and 2009. All six REDS-II blood centers participated in the study:  American Red Cross New England Region, Dedham, MA; the American Red Cross Southern Region, Atlanta, Georgia; the Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; the Hoxworth Blood Center/University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio; the Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and the Blood Centers of the Pacific, San Francisco, California. Two cohorts (2,425 whole blood or double red blood cell donors total) were established; one consisted of 888 first-time (FT) or reactivated (RA) donors and the other consisted of 1,537 frequent donors.  The FT/ RA cohort consisted of men and women who had either never given blood before (FT) or had not given a donation in the two years before enrollment (RA).  The frequent donor cohort consisted of men who had given the equivalent of ≥ 3 and women who had given ≥ 2 red blood cell units in the last year (or equivalent double-red blood cell donations).  Male and females donors were recruited equally for each cohort. Most sites where donors were recruited were fixed rather than mobile sites. Only individuals who successfully donated whole blood or double-RBC units, were not deferred at their enrollment visit, and had agreed to donate frequently in the following 24 months were included in the study."
"IPFNet-STEP IPF","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Network (IPFnet) Sildenafil Trial of Exercise Performance in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (STEP IPF)","IPF is a chronic, progressive lung disease of unknown cause that is characterized by the histopathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. Progression to end-stage respiratory insufficiency and death within 5 years after the onset of symptoms is characteristic. To date, no pharmacologic therapies have definitively been shown to improve survival or quality of life in patients with this disease.

Patients with severe IPF have abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature leading to decreased levels of resting and exercise-induced production of nitric oxide. Since nitric oxide is a potent pulmonary vasodilator, reduced levels are associated with pulmonary vasoconstriction and impaired gas exchange.

Sildenafil (Revatio, Pfizer) is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that stabilizes the second messenger of nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which leads to pulmonary vasodilatation. Such vasodilatation could improve ventilation–perfusion matching and thus gas exchange in patients with IPF.","This study did not show a benefit for sildenafil for the primary outcome. The presence of some positive secondary outcomes creates clinical equipoise for further research. There were small but significant differences in arterial oxygenation, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, degree of dyspnea, and quality of life favoring the sildenafil group.

"DASH","Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)","High blood pressure affects almost 5 million people in the United States and places them at a high risk for cardiovascular disease. High blood pressure is characterized as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg, or higher, or the need for antihypertensive medication. The risk of cardiovascular disease increases progressively throughout the entire range of blood pressure levels, thus blood pressure affects the health of many, including those that are not defined as hypertensive. The DASH aims to help prevent this highly prevalent public health problem.","This trial demonstrated that certain dietary patterns can favorably affect blood pressure in adults with average systolic blood pressures of less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 95 mm Hg. Specifically, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and with reduced saturated and total fat lowered systolic blood pressure by 5.5 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mm Hg more than a control diet. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables also reduced blood pressure, but to a lesser extent. The gradient of blood-pressure reduction across diets indicates that some aspects of the fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced blood pressure and that additional aspects of the combination diet reduced it further. In conclusion, a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and with reduced saturated and total fat can substantially lower blood pressure. Such a diet offers an additional nutritional approach to the prevention and treatment of hypertension.","Heart Diseases, Vascular Diseases, Hypertension, Cardiovascular Diseases","The objective of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study was to test the effects of dietary patterns characterized by high intakes of certain minerals and fiber associated with low blood pressure compared with each other and with a control dietary pattern relatively low in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber, and has a fat and protein profile mirroring current US consumption.","The study consisted of 459 healthy free-living adult men and women, 22 years or older, who have a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 95 mm Hg and a systolic blood pressure less than 160 mm Hg. Since there is a disproportionate burden of hypertensions and its complications in minority populations, and particularly among African Americans, two-thirds of DASH participants are from a minority background."

"P2C2","Pediatric Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Complications of Vertically Transmitted HIV Infection (P2C2)","In 1982, a year after the discovery of AIDS in adults, cases were described in children. Subsequent cross-sectional and short term longitudinal studies indicated that pulmonary and cardiac diseases contributed significantly to morbidity and mortality in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. This study aimed to investigate this hypothesis in a long-term cohort study.","Vertically-transmitted HIV-1 infection is associated with persistent cardiovascular abnormalities identifiable shortly after birth. Irrespective of their HIV-1 status, infants born to women infected with HIV-1 have significantly worse cardiac function than other infants, suggesting that the uterine environment has an important role in postnatal cardiovascular abnormalities.","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, Lung Diseases, Heart Diseases, Heart Failure, Cardiovascular Diseases, HIV Infections, Pneumocystis Carinii Infections, Ebstein-Barr Virus Infections, Cytomegalovirus Infections","The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and natural history of pulmonary and cardiac complications associated with HIV infection in utero, in infancy, and during early childhood.","Children were enrolled at 5 geographically separated centers in Houston, TX, USA; Boston, MA; New York, NY; and Los Angeles, CA. The cohort of subjects included two groups.  Group I was composed of infants and children with vertically transmitted HIV-infection over 28 days of age.  Children in Group I must have been born after April 1, 1985 except where vertical transmission of HIV infection could be documented with reasonable medical certainty and be more than 28 days old.  Group II was composed of fetuses and infants of mothers infected with HIV.

Subjects in group I included children who were likely to develop extensive disease during the course of the study and therefore provide the opportunity to study the full range of cardiovascular and pulmonary complications associated with vertically-transmitted HIV-infection in children.  Group II provided the opportunity to determine the earliest features of infection in the fetus and longitudinally to follow these effects in the child.  Since a proportion of infants in this group were not infected, they represented a control group for the infected infants.

Children in group I (n=205) were a median of 22.9 months of age at enrollment (1.7-166 months) of which 11.7% had asymptomatic infection and 88.3% presented with symptomatic infection. Among 600 infants born to HIV-1–infected women, 432 (72.0 %) were enrolled while their mothers were pregnant and 168 (28.0 %) before 28 days post partum.

"TOPCAT","Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT)","Many patients with heart failure have a normal or near-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Such patients share similar signs and symptoms as patients who have heart failure and a reduced LVEF, as well as an impaired quality of life and a poor prognosis. However at the time of TOPCAT, the benefit of medical therapies for heart failure was limited to those with a reduced LVEF. Due to a lack of favorable evidence from clinical trials, clinical guidelines offered no specific recommendations for the management of heart failure in patients with preserved LVEF except for attention to coexisting conditions.

Among patients with heart failure and a reduced LVEF and those with myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in reducing overall mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure. In small mechanistic studies involving patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular function, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists improved measures of diastolic function. However, rigorous testing was needed regarding their effect on clinical outcomes in patients with preserved LVEF. Therefore, the TOPCAT trial was initiated to determine whether treatment with spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, would improve clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic heart failure and a relatively preserved LVEF.","In patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, treatment with spironolactone did not significantly reduce the incidence of the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure. However, the drug reduced the secondary endpoint of heart failure hospitalization incidence.

Because malnutrition is associated with poor outcomes in critically ill patients, artificial nutrition is often provided, especially in those with acute lung injury (ALI) and with expected longer duration of mechanical ventilation. When feasible, enteral nutrition targeting full caloric needs has been advocated over parenteral nutrition. However, feeding intolerance and common care practices often serve as practical barriers to reaching recommended goals.

Although confounded by indication and severity of illness, several observational studies have shown improved clinical outcomes, including fewer infections, shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, and lower mortality for patients receiving a higher percentage of calculated caloric needs. Nonetheless, the best timing, formulation, and amount of enteral nutrition remain unknown.","There was no difference between groups with regard to the primary end point, VFDs to day 28.

Most studies examined the short-term prognosis following acute infection which was characterized by mild but persistent inflammation. However, reports of late-onset cirrhosis, liver failure or even hepatocellular carcinoma were accumulating from patients with more than 10 years of follow-up.  The frequency, rate of development and contribution to mortality of these sequelae of transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis were not well established.","The data indicated that the frequency of death from all causes among transfusion recipients whom non-A, non-B hepatitis had developed an average of 18 years earlier in virtually identical to that in a carefully matched group of transfusion recipients in whom hepatitis did not develop. There was no increase in the mortality from all causes after transfusion associated non-A, non-B hepatitis, although there was a small, but statistically significant increase in the number of deaths related to liver disease.  With an additional 7 years of follow-up, the liver-related mortality rate attributable to chronic hepatitis C increased among the cases compared to the controls.  Additional follow-up of subjects, restricted to the 3 studies with archived original sera was extended to approximately 25 years.  There remained no increase in the mortality from all causes after transfusion associated non-A, non-B hepatitis.","Blood Transfusion, Liver Diseases, Hepatitis, Viral, Human","This extended follow-up study of 5 major prospective studies of transfusion-associated hepatitis conducted in the US between 1967 and 1980, attempted to address the uncertainty about the frequency progression to clinically symptomatic and debilitating chronic liver disease and the frequency of fatal liver disease.

However, even in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive DLBCL, relapse of lymphoma is a major cause of transplantation failure. Bexxar (iodine I 131 tositumomab) is a radioimmunoconjugate indicated for the treatment of patients with CD20 positive, relapsed or refractory, low grade, follicular, or transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including patients with Rituximab-refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bexxar has been used in several Phase I and II transplant trials either alone or in combination with high-dose chemotherapy for the treatment of relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The trials combining Bexxar with BEAM (chemotherapeutic agents carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation demonstrated promising early results for event-free survival in relapsed chemosensitive DLBCL patients. The additional administration of monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) to the mobilization and conditioning regimen is the standard of care at most transplant centers. Therefore, the BMT CTN 0401 trial was initiated to test the primary hypothesis that the addition of 131 I-tositumomab to a standard high-dose chemotherapy transplantation regimen with BEAM would improve the 2-year progression-free survival compared with the addition of rituximab to the same chemotherapy transplantation protocol in patients with chemotherapy-sensitive persistent or relapsed DLBCL.","The B-BEAM and R-BEAM regimens produced similar 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates for patients with chemotherapy-sensitive relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

"BMT CTN-0402","Blood and Marrow Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) A Phase III Randomized, Multicenter Trial Comparing Sirolimus/Tacrolimus With Tacrolimus/Methotrexate as Graft-versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis After HLA-Matched, Related Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation (0402)","Stem cell transplantation is a standard therapy for leukemia and myelodysplastic disorders. Recipients of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, related donor (MRD) stem cell transplants are at risk for a number of infections and complications. One of these complications is a condition known as acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Recipients of HLA-MRD stem cell transplants for the treatment of myelodysplastic disorders and leukemia experience a 35% incidence of GVHD. Furthermore, GVHD contributes significantly to 1-year early treatment-related mortality (TRM) estimates of approximately 20%.

The standard prophylaxis regimen for GVHD is a calcineurin inhibitor combined with methotrexate. Calcineurin inhibitors block calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that catalyzes some of the intracellular processes associated with T-lymphocyte activation. Inhibition is achieved by binding to immunophilins. The result is reduced production of interleukin-2 and reduced proliferation of T-cells. Methotrexate, an antineoplastic antimetabolite, has immunosuppressant properties that prevents the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate is necessary for synthesis of thymidylate, an essential component of DNA. Of particular clinical concern is the theory that the injury caused by methotrexate to tissues could play a contributory role in initiation of the cytokine cascade associated with GVHD.

The standard prophylaxis regimen for GVHD was established in the mid-1980s. Minor alterations to the standard regimen have shown limited effect on TRM outcomes in spite of the improvements that have been made to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) outcomes. Sirolimus, a rapamycin inhibitor, has been suggested as an alternative for methotrexate. Previous studies have suggested that sirolimus use results in decreased incidence of acute GVHD and treatment-related toxicity after HLA-MRD and unrelated donor transplantation, at the expense of higher rates of endothelial injury syndromes. Sirolimus has additional immunomodulatory properties that include effects on antigen-presenting cells, the thymus, and preservation of regulatory T-cell subsets after transplantation. The purpose of this study was to determine if sirolimus, in place of methotrexate, would produce improved outcomes in GVHD and TRM.","Participants who received Tac/Sir engrafted significantly earlier and had significantly less severe oropharyngeal mucositis after transplantation; however, no difference was observed in the primary end point of GVHD-free survival at 114 days post randomization between participants treated with Tac/Sir and Tac/Mtx.

"PACTG","Anti-HIV Immunoglobulin in Prevention of Maternal-Fetal HIV Transmission: Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 185 (PACTG)","Several studies have identified maternal, obstetrical, and infant characteristics associated with perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, these studies were conducted primarily before the widespread use of zidovudine for the prevention of perinatal transmission. Few studies have identified risk factors for transmission among HIV-1–infected women and infants who are receiving zidovudine, yet such information is critical to the development of new interventions to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission further.","The unexpectedly low transmission confirmed that zidovudine prophylaxis is highly effective, even for women with advanced HIV disease and prior zidovudine therapy, although it limited the study's ability to address whether passive immunization diminishes perinatal transmission (J Infect Dis 1999: 179: 567-75). There were no significant differences between the group that received HIV-1 hyperimmune globulin and the group that received intravenous immune globulin with respect to base-line maternal, obstetrical, and infant characteristics or rates of HIV-1 transmission. Since the rates of perinatal HIV-1 transmission and the clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar in the two groups, data for all women were combined in all subsequent analyses of risk factors. The maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA level was the best predictor of the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1. Antiretroviral therapy that reduces the HIV-1 RNA level to below 500 copies per milliliter appears to minimize the risk of perinatal transmission as well as improve the health of the women (NEJM 1999; 341:385-393).","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, Disease Transmission, Vertical, HIV Infections","To determine if HIV hyperimmune globulin (HIVIG) given to HIV-positive pregnant women during the second and third trimester of pregnancy reduced the likelihood of maternal-fetal HIV transmission.","A total of 501 HIV-1–infected women who were 20 to 30 weeks pregnant, who had CD4+ lymphocyte counts of no more than 500 per cubic millimeter, and who were receiving zidovudine as prescribed by their physicians.

"PACS","Pulmonary Complications of HIV Infection Study (PACS)","Pulmonary infections as a group are the most commonly recognized life threatening disorders in patients with AIDS. Although Pneumocystis carinii was the predominant pulmonary pathogen found in these patients, other organisms were clearly of importance as well, not with early years of the HIV epidemic only in patients with AIDS and ARC but in individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection.

In the mid-1980s, physicians who examined many AIDS patients had the impression that a shift was occurring in the types and incidence of pulmonary complications associated with HIV infection. For example, there appeared to be an increased incidence of serious infections caused by pyogenic bacteria and pulmonary and extrapulmonary infection with M. tuberculosis had been noted with increased frequency. Furthermore, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (LIP), which is diagnostic of AIDS in children under 13 years old who are HIV antibody positive, was diagnosed with increased frequency in adults. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis also appeared to be on the rise. Legionella pneumonia, in contrast to its increased incidence during 1981-83, was seldom encountered by the mid-1980’s.. However, apart from the increased incidence of tuberculosis, a reportable disease, these other shifts in the incidence of pulmonary complications had not been verified.","Pulmonary disease is a common in HIV-infected patients and impacts progression of the HIV, respiratory function and survival.   PACS demonstrated the high incidence of tuberculosis associated with HIV-infection and delineated risk factors for TB.   It established that bacterial pneumonia is more frequent in HIV-positive persons than in seronegative controls, and that the risk is highest among those with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200 per cubic millimeter and among injection-drug users.  In addition, PACS showed that both P. carinii pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia are associated with a significantly worse subsequent HIV disease course and that both Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia result in expiratory airflow reductions that persist after the acute infection resolves. The clinical implications of this are still being explored.  PACS also showed that HIV-infected patients admitted to intensive care units and on mechanical ventilation for PCP and other pulmonary disorders had a high mortality rate, but that mechanical ventilation for non-pulmonary disorders, and admission to the ICU for non-pulmonary diagnoses was associated with a more favorable outcome.","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, AIDS-Related Complex, Lung Diseases, HIV Infections, Pneumocystis Carinii Infections","The objective of PACS was to evaluate the types, incidence, course, and outcome of pulmonary disorders in newly diagnosed cases of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), newly diagnosed cases of AIDS-related complex (ARC) and newly diagnosed asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  Knowledge of the incidence and natural history of pulmonary complications associated with HIV infection was important for establishing diagnostic strategies in the development of new treatment regimens and new approaches for clinical research.","Subjects were recruited from persons who were receiving hospital services, were involved in other cohort studies, homosexual community groups, HIV testing sites, private physicians' practices, methadone treatment programs, support groups; and from unsolicited volunteers.  The study participants included HIV-infected homosexual or bisexual men, male and female injection drug users, and female sexual partners of HIV-infected men.

"H1N1","Novel Influenza A Surveillance Registry (H1N1)","There are no pertinent animal studies of H1N1 influenza. Human studies are limited to case reports or case series which report on relatively limited number of patients. These reports suggest that although severe disease requiring critical care is rare among patients with H1N1 infection, the patients who do require ICU care have a rapidly progressive course with high disease severity. Unlike typical influenza, where the extremes of age (i.e. elderly and very young) and those with underlying cardiopulmonary comorbidities are at increased risk of developing severe and potentially fatal infections, young otherwise healthy patients (including children of all ages), obese patients, and pregnant females appear to be at an increased risk for severe disease from the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.","","Novel Influenza A, H1N1, Influenza","The purpose of this prospective surveillance registry was to characterize the demographics, clinical features, outcomes, and resource utilization of patients with H1N1 influenza infection who require intensive care.","The study data consists of 892 adult subjects and 838 pediatric subjects who were admitted to an intensive care unit at a participating site with confirmed or suspected Novel H1N1 Influenza infection.

"GenTAC","National Registry of Genetically Triggered Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Cardiovascular Conditions (GenTAC)","Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) predispose individuals to life threatening aortic complications, including aortic dissection and rupture. The treatment of complications arising from TAAs is complex, with high rates of morbidity, mortality, and surgical procedures. TAAs are associated with loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and degeneration of extracellular matrix in the aortic wall. This degeneration may be caused by hypertension and inflammation, particularly in elderly individuals. Genetic mutations are the main cause of TAAs in many young or middle-aged individuals. Genetic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, have a high risk for TAA, and up to 20% of individuals with TAAs or dissection have a family history of TAAs without being affected by a known syndrome or known genetic mutation. While diagnostic and treatment advances have dramatically improved care for patients with genetically induced TAAs, many questions remain about how best to identify and treat these disorders. Thus, GenTAC was developed as a longitudinal registry for patients affected by genetically induced thoracic aortic conditions in order to facilitate ongoing and future investigations to improve the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with genetically induced TAAs.  Information gained from studying the genetically induced TAAs is expected to benefit the clinical management of non-genetic TAAs, as well.","GenTAC established a vast biospecimen inventory and clinical database from over 3500 participants that is available to researchers with the ultimate goal of advancing the diagnosis and management of genetically induced thoracic aortic aneurysms and other cardiovascular complications.

The best strategy of care for those with persistent total occlusion of the infarct-related artery, identified after the currently accepted period for administration of reperfusion, was therefore unclear.  Late PCI may improve outcomes over medical management alone, by reducing left ventricular remodeling with preservation of left ventricular function, improving electrical stability, potentially decreasing ventricular arrhythmia, or providing collateral blood flow to coronary territories at risk of future occlusion.","PCI did not reduce the occurrence of death, reinfarction, or heart failure, and there was a trend toward excess reinfarction during 4 years of follow-up.

"WHI (non-BioLINCC)","Women's Health Initiative (WHI)","The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. These chronic diseases are the major causes of death, disability, and frailty in older women of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds.
 

Background (Background information about the study):
The WHI had two major parts: a randomized Clinical Trial and an Observational Study. The randomized controlled Clinical Trial (CT) enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:

• Hormone Therapy Trials (HT): This component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component took hormone pills or a placebo (inactive pill) until the Estrogen plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone trials were stopped early in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out.

• Dietary Modification Trial (DM): The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants followed either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern.

• Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD): This component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component took calcium and vitamin D pills or a placebo.

The Observational Study (OS) is examining the relationship between lifestyle, health and risk factors and specific disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women. Recruitment for the observational study was completed in 1998 and participants were followed for 8 to 12 years.
 

WHI Extension Studies continued follow-up of consenting participants, the first consenting participants from each of the original WHI study components for an additional five years (2005-2010) of follow-up, and the second consenting participants from the first Extension Study for an additional five years (2010-2015). Annual updates on health outcomes are collected by mail from the participants enrolled in each Extension Study. See WHI Timeline for WHI and the Extension Studies.","","Heart Diseases, Myocardial Ischemia, Osteoporosis, Postmenopause, Bone Diseases, Breast Neoplasms, Cardiovascular Diseases, Colonic Neoplasms, Coronary Disease","The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

"ACRN-MIA","Asthma Clinical Research Network Trial (ACRN) - Macrolides in Asthma (MIA)","Research has shown that in some individuals, respiratory airway infections may play a role in the onset and severity of asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used to treat asthma; however, they do not effectively control symptoms for everyone. Clarithromycin, an antibiotic medication used to treat bacterial infections, may be an effective asthma treatment for individuals who do not respond well to inhaled corticosteroids.","Adding clarithromycin to fluticasone in adults with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma that was suboptimally-controlled by low-dose ICS alone did not further improve asthma control. Although there was an improvement in airway hyperresponsiveness with clarithromycin, this benefit was not accompanied by improvements in other secondary outcomes.  (J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2010; 126(4): 747–753)","Asthma","To test the hypothesis that clarithromycin would improve asthma control in individuals with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma that was not well-controlled despite treatment with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).","Participants were eligible if they had a clinical diagnosis of asthma and either bronchodilator responsiveness, defined as an increase of 12% or greater in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 15 minutes after the administration of two puffs of albuterol, or airway hyperresponsiveness, measured by the PC20 FEV1 to methacholine (the concentration of methacholine inducing a 20% fall in FEV1) of ≤ 16 mg/mL. Participants also were required to demonstrate suboptimally-controlled asthma at the time of enrollment, as defined by threshold scores on the Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) of ≥ 1.5 in those not receiving inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatments. Participants receiving ICS-containing treatments could be enrolled with an ACQ score ≥ 1.25 at enrollment or if in the opinion of the investigator the ACQ score was likely to be ≥ 1.25 at the end of the run-in period.

Ninety-two participants were randomized. Twelve (13%) subjects demonstrated PCR evidence of M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae in endobronchial biopsies; 80 were PCR negative for both organisms."
"ROC-HS/TBI","Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Hypertonic Saline Trial Shock Study (HS) and Traumatic Brain Injury Study (TBI)","Trauma is the leading cause of death among North Americans between the ages of 1 and 44 years. The majority of these deaths result from hypovolemic shock or severe brain injury. Patients in hypovolemic shock develop a state of systemic tissue ischemia then a subsequent reperfusion injury at the time of fluid resuscitation. Conventional resuscitation involves the IV administration of a large volume of isotonic or slightly hypotonic (lactated ringers, LR) solutions beginning in the prehospital setting. Although not conclusive, prior studies have suggested that alternative resuscitation with hypertonic saline (7.5%) solutions may reduce morbidity or mortality in these patients. Furthermore, hypertonic fluids may have specific advantages in the brain-injured patient, as they may aid in the rapid restoration of cerebral perfusion and prevent extravascular fluid sequestration, thereby limiting secondary brain injury. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that hypertonicity significantly alters the activation of inflammatory cells, an effect that may reduce subsequent organ injury from ischemia-reperfusion and decrease nosocomial infection. The majority of previous clinical trials have focused on the use of HSD. The potential for 7.5% saline alone (HS) to have similar effects has not been well studied. Removal of the dextran component may enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of this solution, which could improve secondary outcomes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS) and rates of nosocomial infections.","Shock:
Among injured patients with hypovolemic shock, initial resuscitation fluid treatment with either HS or HSD compared with NS, did not result in superior 28-day survival. However, interpretation of these findings is limited by the early stopping of the trial (Ann Surg. 2011; 253(3):431-41).  

TBI:
Among patients with severe TBI not in hypovolemic shock, initial resuscitation with either hypertonic saline or hypertonic saline/dextran, compared with normal saline, did not result in superior 6-month neurologic outcome or survival (JAMA. 2010; 304(13):1455-64).","Shock, Traumatic, Brain Injuries, Traumatic ","Shock:
To determine if prehospital administration of 7.5% hypertonic saline /6% Dextran-70 (HSD) OR 7.5% hypertonic saline alone (HS), compared to current standard therapy with normal saline (NS), as an initial resuscitation fluid, affects survival following traumatic injury with hypovolemic shock.

TBI:
To determine whether out-of-hospital administration of hypertonic fluids improves neurologic outcome following severe TBI.","Shock:
Injured patients, age ≥ 15 years with hypovolemic shock (systolic blood pressure ≤ 70 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 71-90 mm Hg with heart rate ≥ 108 beats per minute).

"BABY HUG","Hydroxyurea to Prevent Organ Damage in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia (BABY HUG) Phase III Clinical Trial and Follow-Up Observational Studies I and II","Sickle cell anemia is associated with substantial morbidity from acute complications and organ dysfunction beginning in the first year of life. In 1995, the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) demonstrated that, in adults, hydroxyurea is effective in decreasing the frequency of painful crises, hospitalizations for crises, acute chest syndrome, and blood transfusions by 50%. The phase I/II study of hydroxyurea in children (HUG KIDS) demonstrated that children have a response to hydroxyurea similar to that seen in adults in terms of increasing fetal hemoglobin levels and total hemoglobin, and decreasing complications associated with sickle cell anemia. In addition, this study demonstrated that the drug does not adversely affect growth and development between the ages of 5 and 15. A pilot study of hydroxyurea (HUSOFT) given to children between the ages of 6 months and 24 months demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated and that the fetal hemoglobin levels rose and remained elevated compared to baseline with continued hydroxyurea administration.

A Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) met on April 12, 1996 to review the results of the MSH trial and the progress to date of the HUG KIDS study. The SEP recommended that NHLBI undertake the BABY HUG trial.

The BABY HUG Randomized Controlled Trial concluded that hydroxyurea treatment in very young children seemed to have an acceptable safety profile and to reduce complications of sickle cell anemia. However, more data were needed on the long-term safety of hydroxyurea use in very young children. As a result, follow-up studies were initiated. The Follow-Up Study II provided longer follow-up than Follow-Up Study I, and included more assessment types than Follow-Up Study I.","On the basis of the safety and efficacy data from this trial, hydroxyurea can be considered for all very young children with sickle cell anemia (Lancet. 2011; 377(9778):1663-72).

As of the time of posting this study, the study investigators have not yet published conclusions from the Follow-Up Study I and II data.","Anemia, Sickle Cell, Hematologic Diseases","The purpose of the Randomized Controlled Trial was to determine if hydroxyurea can safely prevent early end organ damage in very young children with sickle cell anemia.

The purpose of the BABY HUG Follow-up Study I was to provide structured follow-up of the children enrolled in the BABY HUG Randomized Controlled Trial, in order to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with treatment with hydroxyurea at an early age.

The objective of Follow-Up Study II was to obtain additional data about the long-term safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea use in children with Sickle Cell Anemia through at least the first decade of life.","193 participants aged 9–18 months were randomized at 13 trial centers in the United States. (A fourteenth center was opened for enrollment but did not randomize any participants.) Eligible participants had HbSS or HbSβ⁰ thalassaemia, and were enrolled irrespective of clinical severity. All participants received standard age-appropriate care for sickle cell anemia, including penicillin prophylaxis, pneumococcal immunization, and parental education. Participants were excluded for transfusion within 2 months; malignancy; height, weight, or head circumference less than the fifth percentile; severe developmental delay; stroke with neurological deficit; surgical splenectomy; probable or known diagnosis of Hemoglobin S-Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin; known hemoglobin S-beta plus thalassemia (hemoglobin A present); previous or current treatment with HU or another anti-sickling drug; or abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) velocity.

Participants who completed at least 18 months of follow-up in the BABY HUG Randomized Controlled Trial were eligible to participate in Follow-Up Study I. There were 179 such participants. Of these, 163 consented to Follow-Up Study I; 127 agreed to active follow-up, and 36 agreed to passive follow-up. (See design section for descriptions of active and passive follow-up.)

Participants who completed at least 24 months of follow-up in Follow-Up Study I, and had not received stem cell transplant therapy, were eligible to participate in Follow-Up Study II. There were 156 such subjects. Of these, 150 consented to participate in Follow-Up Study II; 130 agreed to active follow-up (one of whom later switched to passive follow-up), and 20 agreed to passive follow-up (one of whom later switched to active follow-up).

"ACRN-LARGE","Asthma Clinical Research Network Trial (ACRN) - Long-Acting Beta Agonist Response by Genotype (LARGE)","Some studies suggest that patients with asthma who are homozygous for arginine at the 16th amino acid position of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (B16 Arg/Arg) benefit less from treatment with long acting beta-2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids than do those homozygous for glycine (B16 Gly/Gly). This study investigated whether there is a genotype-specific response to treatment with a long acting beta-2 agonist in combination with inhaled corticosteroid.","In asthma patients with B16 Arg/Arg and B16 Gly/Gly genotypes, combination treatment with salmeterol and inhaled corticosteroid improved airway function when compared with inhaled corticosteroid therapy alone. These findings suggest that patients should continue to be treated with long acting beta-2 agonists plus moderate-dose inhaled corticosteroids irrespective of B16 genotype. Further investigation is needed to establish the importance of the genotype-specific difference in responsiveness to methacholine (Lancet, 2009; 374(9703): 1754-64).","Asthma","The purpose of this trial was to determine whether regularly scheduled use of an inhaled long-acting beta agonist (salmeterol) in the setting of concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone hydroflouroalkane (HFA) inhaler) would have a detrimental effect on asthma control in people who bear the B16 Arg/Arg genotype of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene, as compared to people with asthma of similar severity who bear the B16 Gly/Gly genotype.","Subjects were adult patients with moderate asthma who were homozygous for arginine or glycine at the 16th amino acid position of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (B16 Arg/Arg or B16 Gly/Gly). Individuals were matched against their opposite genotype by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and race.  A total of 474 patients were screened for the trial between 2004 and 2006.

"VA2-TAH","VA Cooperative Study of the Efficacy of Hepatitis Immune Serum Globulin for the Prevention or Modification of Post-Transfusion Hepatitis (VA2-TAH)","In the mid-1960’s, PTH was a major health problem in the US. Approximately 30,000 cases occurred each year, resulting in 1,500 to 3,000 deaths annually. The incidence of HBs Ag-associated hepatitis declined dramatically after 1973 with the institution of routine screening of donor blood by radioimmunoassay techniques, although no change in the incidence of antigen-negative hepatitis had occurred.   An earlier randomized, double-blind clinical trial had been conducted in 11 Veterans Administration (VA) hospitals between 1969 and 1973 to evaluate the efficacy of immune serum globulin (ISG) in comparison to placebo as prophylaxis against post-transfusion hepatitis.  The results indicated that ISG prohibited the development of PTH in specific circumstances. ISG led to a significant decrease in the incidence of icteric type non-B hepatitis among patients who had been transfused with three or more units of commercial blood, but had little effect on the hepatitis that developed among those that received volunteer donor blood (1).  Since hepatitis B represented 22% of cases of PTH, a second randomized study was undertaken immediately on conclusion of the first one to compare the efficacy of ISG with HBIG.","PTH was diagnosed in 11.0% of the HBIG group (53/482) compared to 14.2% of the ISG group (69/486), p = 0.13 (2,3).  Hepatitis B developed in 4 of 969 patients that received ISG or HBIG although all donor blood was screened and found to be HBsAg–negative by radioimmunoassay.  Subsequent testing of recipient and donor blood samples for anti-HBc demonstrated the importance of anti-HBc as an indicator of hepatitis B infection and supported the hypothesis that high-titer anti-HBc positive blood is infectious (4).","Blood Transfusion, Hepatitis, Viral, Human","This double blind, randomized, controlled trial was designed to test the efficacy of hepatitis B immune serum globulin (HBIG) for the prevention or modification of post-transfusion hepatitis (PTH).","A total of 986 patients were enrolled between 1973 and 1975 at 6 Veterans Administration hospitals.

"ACCORD","Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)","<b>Glycemia Trial:</b>
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus die of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at rates two to four times higher than non-diabetic populations of similar demographic characteristics. They also experience increased rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. With the growing prevalence of obesity in the United States, CVD associated with type 2 diabetes is expected to become an even greater public health challenge in the coming decades than it is now. Expected increases in event rates will be associated with a concomitant rise in suffering and resource utilization. 

The ACCORD study investigated whether intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels would reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease or additional cardiovascular risk factors when compared to standard therapy (HbA1c between 7.0% and 7.9%).  A separate analysis investigated whether reduction of blood glucose concentration decreases the rate of microvascular complications in these patients.

<b>Lipid Therapy Trial:</b>
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease attributable, in part, to associated risk factors such as dyslipidemia. This is characterized by elevated plasma triglyceride levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles.  The ACCORD Lipid Therapy trial was designed to test the effect of a therapeutic strategy that uses a fibrate to raise HDL-C and lower triglyceride levels and uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C reduce the rate of CVD events compared to a strategy that only uses a statin for treatment of LDL-C on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes that were at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

<b>Blood Pressure Trial:</b>
Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of cardiovascular disease at every level of systolic blood pressure.  Because cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes is graded and continuous across the entire range of levels of systolic blood pressure, even at prehypertensive levels, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) recommended beginning drug treatment in patients with diabetes who have systolic blood pressures of 130 mm Hg or higher, with a treatment goal of reducing systolic blood pressure to below 130 mm Hg.  There is, however, a paucity of evidence from randomized clinical trials to support these recommendations. The ACCORD Blood Pressure trial tested the effect of a target systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg on major cardiovascular events among high-risk persons with type 2 diabetes compared to a strategy that targeted a SBP of < 140 mm Hg.

<b>EYE Substudy:</b>
Diabetic retinopathy, an important microvascular complication of diabetes, is a leading cause of blindness in the United States.  Randomized, controlled clinical trials in cohorts of patients with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes have shown the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control and intensive treatment of elevated blood pressure on the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been implicated, in observational studies and small trials, as additional risk factors for the development of diabetic retinopathy and visual loss.  The ACCORD EYE Substudy evaluated the effects of the ACCORD medical strategies on the progression of diabetic retinopathy in a subgroup of trial patients.

<b>MIND Substudy:</b>
Studies suggest that older persons with type 2 diabetes have at least twice the likelihood of developing late-life cognitive impairment or dementia compared to those without. The mechanisms underlying these cognitive disorders are increasingly thought to reflect a mixed pathology pattern with contributions from vascular, neurodegenerative and neurovascular processes. Pathophysiological mechanisms that have been described include inflammation, oxidative stress, energy imbalance, protein misfolding, glucocorticoid-mediated effects and differences in genetic susceptibilities.  The ACCORD MIND substudy took as a premise that early intervention with the ACCORD therapeutic strategies to improve glycemic control could mitigate the adverse effects of type 2 diabetes on the brain.","<b>Glycemia Trial:</b>
As compared with standard therapy, the use of intensive therapy to target normal glycated hemoglobin levels for 3.5 years increased mortality and did not significantly reduce major cardiovascular events. (NEJM.  2008; 358(24): 2545-59).

<b>Microvascular Outcomes of the Glycemia Trial:</b>
Intensive therapy did not reduce the risk of advanced measures of microvascular outcomes, but delayed the onset of albuminuria and some measures of eye complications and neuropathy.  Microvascular benefits of intensive therapy should be weighed against the risk of increased total and cardiovascular disease-related mortality, increased weight gain, and higher risk for severe hypoglycemia. (Lancet. 2010; 376(9739): 419-30)

<b>Lipid Therapy Trial:</b>
The combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin did not reduce the rate of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, as compared with simvastatin alone. These results do not support the routine use of combination therapy with fenofibrate and simvastatin to reduce cardiovascular risk in the majority of high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes (NEJM. 2010; 362(17): 1563–1574).

<b>Blood Pressure Trial:</b>
In patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, did not reduce the rate of a composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events (NEJM. 2010; 362: 1575-1585).

<b>EYE Substudy:</b>
Intensive glycemic control and intensive combination treatment of dyslipidemia, but not intensive blood-pressure control, reduced the rate of progression of diabetic retinopathy (NEJM. 2010; 363: 233-244).

<b>MIND Substudy:</b>
Although significant differences in TBV favored the intensive therapy, cognitive outcomes were not different. Combined with the unfavorable effects on other ACCORD outcomes, MIND findings do not support using intensive therapy to reduce the adverse effects of diabetes on the brain in patients similar to MIND patients (Lancet Neurol. 2011; 10(11): 969–977).","Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Atherosclerosis, Cardiovascular Diseases, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Coronary Disease","The purpose of this study was to determine if intensive glycemic control, multiple lipid management and intensive blood pressure control could prevent major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death) in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Secondary hypotheses included treatment differences in other cardiovascular outcomes, total mortality, microvascular outcomes, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness.","10,251 patients with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c concentrations of 7.5% or more participated in the trial. They were aged 40–79 years with history of cardiovascular disease or 55–79 years with anatomical evidence of significant atherosclerosis, albuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, or at least two risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  Of these patients, 5518 were assigned to the lipid therapy arm and 4733 to the blood pressure arm.  Patients were eligible to participate in the lipid trial if they had the following: an LDL cholesterol level of 60 to 180 mg per deciliter (1.55 to 4.65 mmol per liter), an HDL cholesterol level below 55 mg per deciliter (1.42 mmol per liter) for women and blacks or below 50 mg per deciliter (1.29 mmol per liter) for all other groups, and a triglyceride level below 750 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter) if they were not receiving lipid therapy or below 400 mg per deciliter (4.5 mmol per liter) if they were receiving lipid therapy.  Patients with a systolic blood pressure between 130 and 180 mm Hg who were taking three or fewer antihypertensive medications and who had the equivalent of a 24-hour protein excretion rate of less than 1.0 g were also eligible for the blood-pressure trial.

<b>EYE Substudy:</b>
A subgroup of 2856 patients was evaluated for the effects of the ACCORD interventions at 4 years on the progression of diabetic retinopathy.  Patients who, at baseline, had a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy that had been treated with laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy were excluded.

<b>MIND Substudy:</b>
A subgroup of 2977 patients was evaluated for cognitive function and brain volume.  The ACCORD MIND substudy excluded patients aged <55 years and those in the Veteran’s Administration CCN (to retain the overall sex balance reflected in the other CCNs).  Within ACCORD MIND a group of 632 patients participated in the MRI sub-study."
"EPIC","Effectiveness and Safety of Intermittent Antimicrobial Therapy for the Treatment of New Onset Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Airway Infection in Young Patients with Cystic Fibrosis (EPIC)","CF is an inherited disease that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive tract, which can cause lung infections and digestive problems. It is the most common type of chronic lung disease in children and young adults and may result in early death. There is no cure for this disease. The primary cause of death in individuals with CF is progressive obstructive pulmonary disease associated with chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (PA) infection. PA infection can occur early in life and can become highly resistant to antibiotics. Once an individual has been diagnosed with chronic PA infection, it is almost impossible to manage effectively. The need exists for an effective treatment to control and eliminate PA infection. Past research has shown that if PA infection is treated early, there is a greater likelihood that it may be eliminated completely.","No difference in the rate of exacerbation or prevalence of <i>P aeruginosa</i> positivity was detected between cycled and culture-based therapies.

"ROC-PRIMED","Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed Analysis (PRIMED)","Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a common and lethal problem with a low survival rate, leading to an estimated 330,000 deaths each year in the United States and Canada. The traditional approach to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has been to emphasize early analysis of cardiac rhythm, with delivery of defibrillatory shocks, if indicated, as quickly as possible. It has been suggested, however, that many patients may benefit from a period of CPR before the first analysis of rhythm.

The impedance threshold device (ITD) is designed to enhance venous return and cardiac output during CPR by increasing the degree of negative intrathoracic pressure. Previous studies have suggested that the use of an ITD during CPR may improve survival rates after cardiac arrest. This effect is achieved by preventing the passive inflow of air into the chest during chest recoil between chest compressions without impeding active ventilation. The ITD has been found to improve hemodynamics, the perfusion of vital organs, and neurologically intact survival in studies in animals. The results of small, short-term clinical trials have suggested that the ITD can increase systolic blood pressure during resuscitation and improve short-term survival rates.","All 10 sites halted enrollment in November 2009 when the data and safety monitoring board recommended termination because interim analysis showed that the findings were not likely to change with continuation of the study. Neither use of the ITD nor the amount of CPR given before cardiac rhythm analysis significantly improved survival with satisfactory function (i.e., a score of ≤3 on the modified Rankin scale) among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest receiving standard CPR. There were also no significant differences in the secondary outcomes, including rates of return of spontaneous circulation on arrival at the emergency department, survival to hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge (N Engl J Med.  2011; 365(9): 787-97) (N Engl J Med.  2011; 365(9): 798-806).","Heart Arrest","The purpose of this study was to examine two different treatments during a cardiac arrest that occurs outside of the hospital and whether either or both treatments would increase the number of people who lived to hospital discharge with satisfactory functional status. The first treatment involved using a device called the Impedance Threshold Device (ITD). The other treatment involved the amount of CPR given before the emergency medical services (EMS) providers first looked at the heart rhythm to determine if a shock is needed.","Subjects included adults with nontraumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest being treated with resuscitative efforts by EMS personnel who were participating in the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). Patients were excluded from either treatment if they were incarcerated, known to be pregnant, had do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders, or had exsanguinations, severe burns, blunt, or penetrating injury. Patients were excluded from late vs. early heart rhythm analysis if EMS witnessed the arrest or if a non-EMS individual performed rhythm analysis. Patients were excluded from ITD use if they had an existing tracheostomy, or were undergoing attempted resuscitation with the use of other mechanical CPR devices. In the ITD study, 4,345 patients were assigned to sham ITD and 4,373 to active ITD, while in the early versus later rhythm analysis, 5,290 patients were assigned to early cardiac rhythm analysis, and 4,643 were assigned to later cardiac rhythm analysis. This study qualified for exception from informed consent required for emergency research."
"ROC-CPR","Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Controlled Study of the Clinical Effectiveness of Automated Real-Time Feedback on CPR Process Conducted at a Subset of ROC Sites (CPR)","Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an essential link in the chain of survival for treating cardiac arrest. However, performance of CPR is highly variable both outside hospital and in hospital. Interruptions in chest compression, inadequate depth of chest compression, and high rates of ventilation adversely affect blood flow during chest compressions and can hinder resuscitation. Suboptimal CPR, particularly time spent without chest compressions (low chest compression fraction), can reduce survival of cardiac arrest patients.

Current technology incorporated into a monitor-defibrillator can assess core components of CPR through the use of an accelerometer and impedance changes across the defibrillation electrodes. This technology can also provide real-time audiovisual feedback so that the rescuer is prompted to perform according to guideline specifications. Use of such feedback increases the likelihood of performing CPR in accordance with guidelines during training and simulation.","Real-time visual and audible feedback during CPR altered performance to more closely conform with CPR guidelines. Clusters assigned to feedback were associated with increased proportion of time in which chest compressions were provided, increased compression depth, and decreased proportion of compressions with incomplete release. However, frequency of prehospital return of spontaneous circulation did not differ according to feedback status, nor did the presence of a pulse at hospital arrival, survival to discharge, or awake at hospital discharge.  (BMJ. 2011 Feb 4;342:d512)","Heart Arrest","A substudy of the ROC PRIMED trial, the ROC CPR trial sought to investigate whether real-time audio and visual feedback during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) outside a hospital increases the proportion of subjects who achieved prehospital return of spontaneous circulation.","The study subjects were adults aged ≥20 years who had a cardiac arrest outside hospital and received rescue shocks or chest compressions by a participating emergency medical service with a monitor-defibrillator capable of real-time CPR feedback. Subjects were excluded if known to be prisoners or pregnant, if the cardiac arrest was due to traumatic causes, or if the subject had a “do not resuscitate” order. There were 1586 subjects total: 771 treated without feedback and 815 with feedback."
"BARI 2D","Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation in Type 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D)","Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of cardiovascular events and death than those without diabetes. Few large, randomized trials have addressed the question of the optimal treatment for patients with diabetes and angiographically defined stable ischemic heart disease. 

Among patients with diabetes, studies have indicated that increased insulin levels predict adverse outcomes and that control of hyperglycemia by reducing insulin resistance, rather than by providing insulin, might improve cardiovascular outcomes. The effectiveness of coronary revascularization in relieving angina is well established; however, its benefit in reducing the rates of subsequent myocardial infarction and death has been shown only in patients with high-risk profiles or acute coronary syndromes. Studies of coronary revascularization in patients with moderate or with mild or no symptoms have had conflicting results. Unfortunately, such trials have not focused on patients with diabetes, who are at high risk with even mild symptoms of myocardial ischemia.","Overall, there was no significant difference in the rates of death and major cardiovascular events between patients undergoing prompt revascularization and those undergoing medical therapy or between strategies of insulin sensitization and insulin provision. (N Engl J Med. 2009 June 11; 360(24): 2503–2515.)","Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Diseases, Insulin Resistance, Cardiovascular Diseases, Coronary Disease, Diabetes Mellitus, Non-insulin Dependent","The BARI 2D trial was designed to test treatment strategies for patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes. The goal was to address the effects of therapy on the rate of myocardial ischemia, and of insulin resistance. The study evaluated two cardiac treatment strategies (prompt revascularization vs. medical therapy alone) and two glycemic treatment strategies (insulin sensitization vs. insulin provision).

The first hypothesis was that prompt revascularization (either surgical or catheter-based) would reduce long-term rates of death and cardiovascular events, as compared with medical therapy alone. The second hypothesis was that a strategy of insulin sensitization (with a target level for glycated hemoglobin of less than 7.0%) would reduce long-term rates of death and cardiovascular events, as compared with a strategy of insulin provision.","From January 1, 2001, to March 31, 2005, 2368 patients were enrolled at 49 clinical sites in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, the Czech Republic, and Austria. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of both type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. All patients had to be candidates for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients were excluded if they required immediate revascularization or had left main coronary disease, a creatinine level of more than 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter), a glycated hemoglobin level of more than 13.0%, class III or IV heart failure, or hepatic dysfunction or if they had undergone PCI or CABG within the previous 12 months."
"HFN-DOSE AHF","Heart Failure Network (HFN) Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (DOSE AHF)","Acute decompensated heart failure is the most common cause of hospital admissions among patients older than 65 years of age and is responsible for more than 1 million hospitalizations annually in the United States. Intravenous loop diuretics are an essential component of current treatment and are administered to approximately 90% of patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite decades of clinical experience with these agents, prospective data to guide the use of loop diuretics are sparse, and current guidelines are based primarily on expert opinion. As a result, clinical practice varies widely with regard to both the mode of administration and the dosing.","Among patients with acute decompensated heart failure, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus as compared with continuous infusion or at a high dose as compared with a low dose. (N Engl J Med. Mar 3, 2011; 364(9): 797–805.)","Heart Failure","The DOSE study sought to evaluate the most effective dosing (high vs. low) and administration (continuous infusion vs. intermittent boluses) combination of the diuretic Furosemide in the treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure.","A total of 308 patients were enrolled between March 2008 and November 2009 at 26 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had presented within the previous 24 hours with acute decompensated heart failure. Additional eligibility criteria were a history of chronic heart failure and receipt of an oral loop diuretic for at least 1 month before hospitalization. Patients with systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a serum creatinine level that was greater than 3.0 mg per deciliter and patients requiring intravenous vasodilators or inotropic agents (other than digoxin) for heart failure were excluded."
"SHHS","Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)","Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is a potentially debilitating condition characterized by repetitive episodes of apnea while asleep, nocturnal oxygen desaturation, excessive daytime sleepiness, and loud disruptive snoring. Epidemiologic data from middle-aged adults indicate that OSA is common, with prevalence rates of 4% in men and 2% in women.  Prior studies implicated OSA as a risk factor for the development of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke and consequently premature death.  Questions arose as to whether an increased propensity for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases was limited to only those with frank OSA or whether more subtle forms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) would also confer elevated risk. Further evidence was also needed to clarify whether, SDB, including OSA, is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease.  Known cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk factors such as obesity and smoking are commonly present in those with SDB; therefore, apparent associations between SDB and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases may have resulted from the effects of these concomitant risk factors. Moreover, there was no understanding as to whether such factors as race, age, gender, and prevalent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease might interact with SDB to alter future cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk. Mechanisms underlying any propensity to develop cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease with SDB had not been firmly established (Quan SF, Howard BV, Iber C, Kiley JP, Nieto FJ, O'Connor GT, Rapoport DM, Redline S, Robbins J, Samet JM, Wahl PW.

The “parent” cohorts included:

- The Hagerstown and Minneapolis/St. Paul sites of the <a href=""https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/aric/"">Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC)</a>
- The Hagerstown, Sacramento and Pittsburgh sites of the <a href=""https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/chs/"">Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)</a>

- The Strong Heart Study (SHS) sites in South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Arizona
- The New York Hypertension Cohorts 
- The Tucson Epidemiologic Study of Airways Obstructive Diseases and the Health and Environment Study

From these parent cohorts, a sample of participants who met the inclusion criteria (age 40 years or older; no history of treatment of sleep apnea; no tracheostomy; no current home oxygen therapy) was invited to participate in the baseline examination of the SHHS, which included an initial polysomnogram (SHHS-1). Several cohorts over-sampled snorers in order to increase the study-wide prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. In all, 6441 individuals were enrolled between November 1, 1995 and January 31, 1998. 

During exam cycle 3 (January 2001- June 2003), a second polysomnogram (SHHS-2) was obtained in 3295 of the participants.

Due to sovereignty issues, Strong Heart Study participants are not included in the shared SHHS data.  Data from a total of 5804 participants (1915 ARIC, 1230 CHS, 688 Framingham Offspring and 1971 from other studies), consenting to share data are available."
"WNV","West Nile Virus Study (WNV)","WNV is the third most important mosquito-borne virus after malaria and dengue virus.  Humans are infected by mosquito bites, blood transfusion and organ transplantation.  While most infections are asymptomatic or mild, causing a self-limiting febrile illness, the young, old and immunocompromised individuals are at greater risk for severe, sometimes fatal disease.  WNV first appeared in the US in 1999 raising concerns for blood supply safety.  In the US epidemic of 2002 there were 23 cases of transfusion-transmitted infections (Pealer et al., NEJM 2003).  The virus has spread rapidly across the US such that by the end of 2003 there were 19,000 documented cases of WNV infections in the US with 750 fatalities.  Testing the blood supply was implemented in 2003. By 2013, 12 transfusion-associated WNV transmissions have been documented in the US.","","West Nile Virus, Blood Donors, Infection","The goal of the study was to enroll West Nile Virus (WNV) viremic donors into longitudinal natural history study, and characterize viral and immunological parameters.","A total of 63 WNV+ subjects, of which 54 WNV+ had symptom questionnaires and longitudinal samples collected for characterization and inclusion in the database and repository.

"IPFNet-ACE IPF","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Network (IPFnet) AntiCoagulant Effectiveness in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ACE IPF)","IPF is a chronic, progressive lung disease of unknown cause characterized by the histopathologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. The median survival of patients with IPF after the onset of symptoms is 2 to 5 years. Prior animal and human studies in pulmonary fibrosis provide a compelling rationale to examine anticoagulation as a therapeutic approach in IPF. Large epidemiologic studies link IPF with thrombosis-related clinical events, such as an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome and deep vein thrombosis. The suspected causal relationship may extend beyond simple coagulation cascade-induced thrombus formation, as procoagulant enzymes may directly stimulate fibrosis via cell surface receptor–mediated responses.","The study did not show a benefit for warfarin in the treatment of patients with progressive IPF and was terminated due to excess mortality in the warfarin treatment group. Treatment with warfarin was associated with an increased risk of mortality in an IPF population who lacked other indications for anticoagulation.

Reported causes of death indicated 11 of the 14 were respiratory-related in the warfarin group versus three of the three in the placebo group. There were also three cardiovascular deaths in the warfarin group versus none in the placebo group. No deaths were attributed to bleeding. The warfarin group also demonstrated an increased rate of combined all-cause hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
(Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2012 Jul 1;186(1):88-95.)","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","The ACE-IPF trial tested the hypothesis that treatment with warfarin at recognized therapeutic doses would reduce rates of mortality, hospitalization, and declines in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) in subjects with Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).","Patients aged 35 to 80 years with progressive IPF were potentially eligible. Progressive IPF was defined as a history of (1) worsening of dyspnea, or (2) physiologic deterioration defined as an absolute decline of either FVC greater than or equal to 10% or DlCO greater than or equal to 15%, a reduction in arterial oxygen saturation of greater than or equal to 5%, or progression of radiographic findings. Between December 14, 2009 and April 1, 2011, 145 subjects were enrolled: 72 in the warfarin group and 73 in the placebo group. The mean age for the population was 67 years. 27% of the subjects were women and 92% were white.

Participants were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: current indication for, or treatment with, warfarin, prasugrel, or clopidogrel combined with aspirin; the presence of an increased risk of bleeding; a recent cerebral vascular accident or gastrointestinal bleeding; any current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive, or uncontrolled comorbid illness; and their presence on the active list for lung transplantation."

Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) can modulate inflammatory responses. Previous observational studies suggested that statins improved clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis.","The study was stopped because of futility after 745 of an estimated 1000 patients had been enrolled. There was no significant difference between study groups in 60 day in-hospital mortality or in mean ventilator-free days. The rosuvastatin group had fewer days free of hepatic or renal failure. Thus, rosuvastatin therapy did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS and may have contributed to hepatic and renal organ dysfunction.","Lung Diseases, ARDS, ALI, Acute Lung Injury, Sepsis","The SAILS trial was intended to assess the efficacy and safety of oral rosuvastatin in patients with sepsis-induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and test the hypothesis that rosuvastatin therapy would improve the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).","Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were receiving positive-pressure mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube, had a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 300 or less, and had bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography that were consistent with pulmonary edema, without evidence of left atrial hypertension. Additionally, the subjects needed to meet at least one criterion for a systemic inflammatory response: a white blood cell count greater than 12,000 or less than 4,000 or at least 10% band forms, or a core body temperature of more than 38°C or less than 36°C."
"HCHS-SOL","Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL)","In the last decades, the US Hispanic and Latino population has increased dramatically, now comprising the nation’s largest minority group. Cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of mortality among Hispanic/Latino individuals in the United States, and this relatively young ethnic group is at high risk of future CVD morbidity and mortality as it ages. Evidence also suggests that CVD risk factors and disease rates may vary considerably among Hispanic/Latino groups. Risk for CVDs among Hispanic/Latino individuals has been reported to differ by degree of acculturation and duration of residence in the United States.

HCHS-SOL expands the literature on Hispanic/Latino health by describing the prevalence of 5 major, readily measured biomedical CVD risk factors (high serum cholesterol and blood pressure levels, obesity, hyperglycemia/diabetes, cigarette smoking), adverse CVD risk profiles (combinations of CVD risk factors), and CVD (coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) among US Hispanic/Latino adults of diverse backgrounds.","","Cardiovascular Diseases","The Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS-SOL) sought to describe prevalence of major Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors and CVD among US Hispanic/Latino individuals of different backgrounds, examine relationships of SES and acculturation with CVD risk profiles and CVD, and assess cross-sectional associations of CVD risk factors with CVD.","Participants included individuals of Cuban (n =2201), Dominican (n = 1400), Mexican (n=6232), Puerto Rican (n=2590), Central American (n=1634), and South American backgrounds (n = 1022) aged 18 to 74 years.

The median survival of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after diagnosis is 2 to 5 years. To date, no pharmacologic therapies have been shown to improve survival. Acetylcysteine has been suggested as a beneficial treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, although data from placebo-controlled studies are lacking.","As compared with placebo, acetylcysteine offered no significant benefit with respect to the preservation of FVC in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with mild-to-moderate impairment in lung function. In addition, there were no significant differences between the acetylcysteine group and the placebo group in the rates of death or acute exacerbation.

"POWER-UP","Practice Based Opportunities for Weight Reduction Trial at the University of Pennsylvania (POWER-UP)","Investigators are searching for new approaches to the treatment of obesity during routine medical visits. Trials in which primary care providers (PCPs) offer counseling about diet and activity have led to weight loss of 2.5 kg or less over study periods ranging from 6 to 18 months. Limited treatment contact is probably responsible for this modest degree of weight loss. Given the demands on providers' time, an increase in the frequency of PCP counseling does not appear to be feasible. As an alternative, Tsai et al. trained medical assistants to deliver individual lifestyle counseling with the use of an abbreviated version of the Diabetes Prevention Program. Overweight patients who received eight brief counseling sessions (and met quarterly with their PCP to manage coexisting illnesses) lost 4.4 kg in 6 months, as compared with 0.9 kg for the patients in the control group, who were limited to quarterly PCP visits. The POWER-UP study expanded on this pilot investigation by assessing brief lifestyle counseling delivered monthly in a 2-year, randomized trial conducted in the primary care setting.","Weight loss at 24 months with usual care, brief lifestyle counseling, and enhanced brief lifestyle counseling was 1.7±0.7, 2.9±0.7, and 4.6±0.7 kg, respectively. Initial weight decreased at least 5% in 21.5%, 26.0%, and 34.9% of the participants in the three groups, respectively. Enhanced lifestyle counseling was superior to usual care on both these measures of success with no other significant differences among the groups.

"CHAT","A Randomized Controlled Study of Adenotonsillectomy for Children with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (CHAT)","Childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including cognitive and behavioral deficits. The most commonly identified risk factor for the childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Thus, the primary treatment is adenotonsillectomy, which accounts for more than 500,000 procedures annually in the United States alone.  However its usefulness in reducing symptoms and improving cognition, behavior, quality of life, and polysomnographic findings has not been rigorously evaluated.","As compared with a strategy of watchful waiting, surgical treatment for the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in school-age children did not significantly improve attention or executive function as measured by neuropsychological testing but did reduce symptoms and improve secondary outcomes of behavior, quality of life, and polysomnographic findings, thus providing evidence of beneficial effects of early adenotonsillectomy.

Dyslipidemia is one of the major modifiable risk factors of atherosclerosis. Elevated LDL cholesterol levels are an established predictor of CHD risk, while elevated levels of HDL cholesterol inhibit plaque formation and have a strong association with lower rates of incident CHD events. An increasingly common dyslipidemia seen among patients with established vascular disease is atherogenic dyslipidemia (low levels of HDL cholesterol, elevated triglyceride levels, and small, dense particles of LDL cholesterol) which presents an increased risk for CHD and cardiovascular events. Statin therapy has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events. However, substantial residual risk persists despite the achievement of target LDL cholesterol levels.","Among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  and low levels of HDL cholesterol, there was no incremental clinical benefit from the addition of niacin to intensive statin therapy during a 36-month follow-up period, despite significant improvements in HDL cholesterol.

"SCD-HeFT","Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT)","Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) can die suddenly and unpredictably from arrhythmia despite the use of proven medical therapies, such as beta-blockade. Two approaches have been developed to prevent sudden death among patients with CHF: therapy with amiodarone and therapy with an ICD. However, most of the mortality data on amiodarone and ICD therapy at the time of the study had been obtained in clinical trials performed after myocardial infarction in patients without CHF or those with ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, more data was needed to guide these therapies in patients who did not meet these criteria.","In subjects with NYHA class II or III CHF and LVEF of 35% or less, amiodarone had no favorable effect on survival, whereas single-lead, shock-only ICD therapy reduced overall mortality by 23%.

"HFN-RELAX","Heart Failure Network (HFN) Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Diastolic Heart Failure (RELAX)","Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common and highly morbid condition that is characterized by chronic exercise intolerance, progressive functional decline and a high rate of readmission. At the time of the RELAX trial, clinical trials of renin-angiotensin system antagonists had not demonstrated improvement in outcomes or clinical status in HFpEF, and effective therapies were needed. Phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) metabolizes the nitric oxide (NO) and natriuretic peptide (NP) systems’ second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and thus may limit beneficial NO and NP actions in the heart, vasculature and kidney. Pre-clinical studies suggest that inhibition of PDE-5 reverses adverse cardiac structural and functional remodeling and enhances vascular, neuroendocrine and renal function. In clinical studies, PDE-5 inhibitor therapy improved exercise tolerance and clinical status in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). A small, single-center study in HFpEF observed improved hemodynamics, left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, right ventricular (RV) systolic function, LV hypertrophy and lung function with chronic PDE-5 inhibition as compared to placebo. In aggregate, these studies suggested the potential for PDE-5 inhibition to ameliorate several key pathophysiological perturbations in HFpEF, and thus improve exercise capacity and clinical status.","Chronic phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor therapy with sildenafil for 24 weeks did not alter exercise capacity or clinical status compared to placebo in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction.

"ROMICAT-II","Rule Out Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction by Computer Assisted Tomography (ROMICAT-II)","Treatment of patients with acute chest pain but an inconclusive initial evaluation with the use of biomarkers and electrocardiographic testing is often diagnostically challenging and inefficient. The majority of patients with acute coronary syndromes have underlying coronary artery disease. Contrast-enhanced CCTA has high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of clinically significant coronary artery disease, as compared with invasive coronary angiography, in patients in stable condition with suspected or known coronary artery disease.

Rule Out Myocardial Infarction/Ischemia Using Computer Assisted Tomography (ROMICAT-I), a blinded observational study involving patients in the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndromes, and other studies have shown that normal findings on CCTA have a very high negative predictive value for ruling out acute coronary syndromes during the index hospitalization and the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events over the next 2 years. The results of two previous randomized, multicenter trials suggest that CCTA may facilitate safe and earlier triage of low-risk patients and that CCTA can rule out coronary artery disease faster than stress myocardial-perfusion imaging. However, imaging the coronary anatomy with CCTA can involve more procedures and greater costs than functional testing. Thus, ROMITCAT-II sought to evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating CCTA into an evaluation strategy in the emergency department.","In patients in the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndromes, incorporating CCTA into a triage strategy improved the efficiency of clinical decision making, as compared with a standard evaluation in the emergency department, but it resulted in an increase in downstream testing and radiation exposure with no decrease in the overall costs of care. The average length of hospital stay for patients in the CCTA group was significantly less (7.6 hours) than the standard evaluation group.

"HF-ACTION","Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION)","Heart failure (HF) is a major and growing cardiovascular syndrome that is the end result of many cardiovascular disorders. Although evidence-based drug and device therapies decrease mortality, hospitalizations, and HF symptoms and improve quality of life, many patients treated with these regimens often remain burdened by dyspnea and fatigue, diminished exercise tolerance, reduced quality of life, recurrent hospitalizations, and early mortality.

Whereas rest was traditionally recommended for HF patients, there has been evidence that physical deconditioning may play a key role in the progression of symptoms and poor outcomes. Previous studies have shown positive effects of exercise training on exercise capacity, quality of life, and biomarkers and suggest that exercise training might improve survival and decrease HF hospitalizations. Nonetheless, there remains a safety concern regarding exercise training in HF and a large scale, multicenter, controlled clinical trial was needed to provide definitive clinical outcome data.","After adjustment for highly prognostic predictors of the primary end point, exercise training was associated with modestly significant reductions for both all-cause mortality or hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization.

"LHMP","The Lung HIV Microbiome Project (LHMP)","The respiratory tract is constantly exposed to the external environment and serves as the portal of entry for many microbes. The characteristics and mix of organisms populating the respiratory tract, coupled with the state of local respiratory defenses are key factors in determining whether a person remains healthy or develops acute, chronic, or latent infection. Inflammation in the airways and lungs and how it progresses or is resolved affects not only local immune mediators and primary gas exchange functions, but may also have consequences for the whole immune system and the progression of diseases in other organs.

HIV-infected individuals are at high risk of developing pneumonias caused by pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms. These respiratory infections frequently cause morbidity, are often life threatening, and may increase the rate of replication of HIV, accelerating the course of the disease. HIV-infected individuals experience a decrease in lung function following pneumonias which are not observed in normal, HIV-uninfected populations. Furthermore, lung infections and microbial colonizations are suspected in the etiology of HIV-associated emphysema and pulmonary hypertension. An increasingly important issue is that lung infections may play a role in inducing the immune reconstitution syndrome seen in some HIV-infected patients following initiation of multi-drug antiretroviral regimens. 

Therefore, knowledge of the lung microbiome in healthy and diseased states may lead to the identification of predictors of disease progression and therapeutic targets for translation into better preventive and treatment strategies. The LHMP was developed as a cooperative network responsible for carrying out both joint protocols and integrating independent protocols that benefit from increased sample size. This effort was meant to provide initial data to develop further hypotheses addressing differences between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals.","","Lung Diseases, HIV-1","To characterize the microbiome of the lung and respiratory tract, and enhance understanding of the role of the lung microbiome in preserving health or causing disease and in the divergent effects observed in HIV-infected versus uninfected individuals.","Eligible subjects included HIV positive and HIV negative adults.

"CORAL","Cardiovascular Outcomes in Renal Atherosclerotic Lesions (CORAL)","Renal-artery stenosis, which is present in 1 to 5% of people with hypertension, often occurs in combination with peripheral arterial or coronary artery disease. Results of community-based screening suggest that the prevalence among persons older than 65 years of age may be as high as 7%. Renal-artery stenosis may result in hypertension, ischemic nephropathy, and multiple long-term complications. Uncontrolled studies performed in the 1990s suggested that renal-artery angioplasty or stenting resulted in significant reductions in systolic blood pressure and in the stabilization of chronic kidney disease. Subsequently, there were rapid increases in the rate of renal-artery stenting among Medicare beneficiaries, with the annual number of procedures increasing 364% between 1996 and 2000. However, three randomized trials of renal-artery angioplasty failed to show a benefit with respect to blood pressure. Two subsequent randomized trials of stenting did not show a benefit with respect to kidney function. At the time of the CORAL trial, no studies had been designed specifically to assess clinical outcomes.

Given the prevalence of atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis, this condition is an important public health issue. If stenting prevents the progression of chronic kidney disease and lowers blood pressure, it has the potential to prevent serious health consequences, including adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In contrast, if stenting confers neither of these benefits, it is likely to incur substantial cost without a public health advantage. Therefore, CORAL researchers performed a randomized clinical trial to determine the effects of renal-artery stenting on the incidence of important cardiovascular and renal adverse events.","Renal-artery stenting did not confer a significant benefit with respect to the prevention of clinical events when added to comprehensive, multifactorial medical therapy in people with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and hypertension or chronic kidney disease.

Severe renal-artery stenosis was defined angiographically as stenosis of at least 80% but less than 100% of the diameter or stenosis of at least 60% but less than 80% of the diameter of an artery, with a systolic pressure gradient of at least 20 mm Hg. During the course of enrollment, the criteria was modified so that patients who did not have systolic hypertension but who had renal-artery stenosis could be enrolled if they had chronic kidney disease, which was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 of body-surface area. Severe renal-artery stenosis could be identified with the use of duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography, or computed tomographic angiography.

"CLEVER","Claudication: Exercise Versus Endoluminal Revascularization (CLEVER)","Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a major source of morbidity and mortality, particularly in older individuals. Claudication is a common and disabling symptom of peripheral artery disease that can be treated with medication, supervised exercise (SE), or stent revascularization (ST). Despite its high prevalence, clinicians often fail to diagnose PAD, particularly in patients who do not have classic claudication symptoms. Although there is a growing body of literature demonstrating the value of exercise rehabilitation in individuals with PAD and claudication, exercise rehabilitation is not often prescribed as it is not reimbursed by Medicare, and is rarely covered by private insurance. Therefore, few individuals with PAD and intermittent claudication have access to supervised exercise rehabilitation.

At the time of the CLEVER trial, the use of surgical intervention and stent placement to improve blood flow in patients who did not have ischemic pain at rest or limb-threatening ischemia was controversial. There was data suggesting that patients with intermittent claudication who had revascularization with stents have improved exercise capacity and walking times.
 
Thus the CLEVER trial was initiated to compare the benefits of optimal medical therapy, structured exercise, and stent revascularization on both walking outcomes and measures of quality of life in patients with claudication due to aortoiliac PAD.","Supervised exercise resulted in superior treadmill walking performance as compared to stent placement, even for those with aortoiliac peripheral artery disease.

"Lung HIV","Longitudinal Studies of HIV-Associated Lung Infections and Complications (Lung HIV)","As of 2011, approximately 33 million people have HIV. Antiretroviral therapy and similar clinical strategies have improved survival rates and turned HIV infection into a chronic disease. However, persistent loss of immunity from HIV infection results in increased development of comorbid diseases that significantly affect mortality. Many HIV-infected persons in resource-limited regions experience serious or fatal lung complications that are poorly characterized. Thus, the LUNG HIV Study was established as a collaborative multi-R01 consortium created to address missing links in the knowledge of HIV-associated pulmonary diseases.","Lung diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals, and the lung infections and complications associated with HIV infection are broad. Ongoing research within the Lung HIV Study seeks to characterize the lung complications occurring in HIV-infected individuals and to provide insights into pathogenesis of these complications.

"HFN-ROSE","Heart Failure Network (HFN) Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure and Reliable Evaluation of Dyspnea (ROSE)","A primary treatment goal in acute heart failure is to achieve adequate decongestion while avoiding renal dysfunction and other side effects. Patients with acute heart failure and moderate or severe renal dysfunction are at risk for inadequate decongestion and worsening renal function—both of which are associated with worse outcomes. Renal adjuvant therapies that enhance decongestion and preserve renal function during treatment of acute heart failure are needed.

Dopamine is an endogenous catecholamine which at low doses, may selectively activate dopamine receptors and promote renal vasodilatation. Previous studies have suggested that the addition of low dose dopamine to diuretic therapy enhances decongestion and preserves renal function during diuretic therapy in acute heart failure; however, these studies were small with variable study designs and dopamine doses.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac peptide with vasodilating, renin and aldosterone inhibiting, natriuretic and diuretic properties. Nesiritide is human recombinant BNP approved for management of acute heart failure. The recommended dose lowers blood pressure and atrial pressures and produces modest improvement in dyspnea, but does not favorably impact clinical outcomes or renal function, potentially due to its hypotensive effects.  Small studies using low dose nesiritide in acute heart failure and cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated favorable effects on urine output and renal function.

Therefore, the Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation (ROSE) trial was initiated to determine the benefits and safety of intravenous administration of low dose nesiritide or low dose dopamine in patients with congestive heart failure and kidney dysfunction.","In participants with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction, neither low-dose dopamine nor low-dose nesiritide enhanced decongestion or improved renal function when added to diuretic therapy.","Heart Failure","To test the two independent hypotheses that when compared to placebo, addition of: (1) low dose dopamine; or (2) low dose nesiritide to diuretic therapy will enhance decongestion and preserve renal function in patients with acute heart failure and renal dysfunction.","Eligible patients were adults with a diagnosis of acute heart failure who had renal dysfunction. The diagnosis of heart failure was based on at least one symptom (dyspnea, orthopnea, or edema) and one sign of heart failure (rales, edema, ascites, or pulmonary vascular congestion on chest radiography) regardless of ejection fraction. Prior clinical diagnosis of heart failure must have been identified within 24 hours of hospital admission. Renal dysfunction was defined as an estimated GFR of 15 to 60 mL/min/1.73m2 determined by the MDRD equation."
"COAG","Clarification of Optimal Anticoagulation Through Genetics (COAG)","Warfarin is highly efficacious at preventing thromboembolism, a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Individuals taking warfarin require dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR), particularly at the beginning of therapy. Out of range INR can increase risk of thromboembolism, bleeding, and early discontinuation of a highly useful therapy. Genotype-guided dosing of warfarin may be a more effective way of dosing warfarin when compared to only using clinical information.  Observational studies have identified two genes, CYP2C9 and VKORC1, that are associated with variation in warfarin maintenance doses. Prior to the COAG trial, the effectiveness of genotype-guided dosing of warfarin had been limited to small clinical trials or observational studies, with equivocal results. Therefore comparison of the two strategies was needed to determine if use of genetic information is more effective in warfarin dosing than using clinical information.","Genotype-guided dosing of warfarin did not improve anticoagulation control during the first 4 weeks of therapy.

"STOP II","Optimizing Primary Stroke Prevention in Children with Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP II)","Stroke causes substantial morbidity in children with sickle cell disease. To prevent first strokes, the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) used prophylactic transfusions in children who were identified by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography as being at high risk for stroke. This strategy reduced the incidence of stroke among such children from 10% per year to less than 1% per year, leading to recommendations for TCD screening and prophylactic transfusion for children with abnormal velocities on ultrasonography.

Despite the reduced risk of stroke, long-term use of transfusions can cause adverse side effects, such as iron overload or alloimmunization. However, cessation of transfusions is associated with recurrence of stroke, and at the time of the STOP II trial, there were no clinical or laboratory indicators to guide the duration of prophylaxis. Therefore the STOP II trial was initiated to determine whether transfusions could be limited by monitoring patients with TCD examinations after transfusions were halted and resuming transfusions if the examination indicated a high risk of stroke.","The trial was halted for safety concerns after 79 of a planned 100 children were randomized. Discontinuation of transfusion for the prevention of stroke in children with sickle cell disease resulted in a high rate of reversion to abnormal blood-flow velocities on Doppler studies and stroke incidence.

It is a common complication of sickle cell disease and initially presents with the symptom of shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion.  As the condition worsens, other symptoms such as dizziness, lower extremity edema, and chest pain can develop.  The drug, sildenafil, works by relaxing blood vessels in the lungs which reduces pulmonary blood pressure and allows more oxygenated blood to circulate. Increased levels of oxygenated blood allows individuals with PAH to tolerate more activity, but guidelines for using sildenafil in patients with PAH and sickle cell disease were unavailable at the time of the walk-PHaSST trial.","There was no evidence that treatment with sildenafil impacted the six minute walk distance from baseline to week 16.

"THAPCA-OH","Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (Out of Hospital) (THAPCA-OH)","Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are associated with high rates of mortality and disability. Cardiac arrest is a sudden, unexpected loss of heart function that may result in injury to the brain from insufficient blood flow and oxygen.  In 2002, clinical trials involving adults reported that therapeutic hypothermia improved neurologic outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.  International guidelines recommended therapeutic hypothermia for adults with similar clinical presentations to the 2002 trial participants. Conversely, observational studies have not associated therapeutic hypothermia with improved outcomes in children after a cardiac arrest. The THAPCA-OH trial was initiated due to the lack of published results from randomized trials on pediatric populations, and the significant differences that exist regarding cardiac arrest in pediatric and adult populations.  The THAPCA-OH trial compared the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia and therapeutic normothermia in pediatric populations after out-of-hospital cardiac arrests by measuring 12-month survival rates with good neurobehavioral outcomes.","Among the patients who had a VABS-II score of at least 70 before cardiac arrest, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the hypothermia group and the normothermia group. Among all randomized patients, the change in the VABS-II score from baseline to 12 months was not significantly different and 1-year survival was similar between the groups.

For example, cigarette smoke-induced chronic bronchitis and emphysema are subsumed within the COPD definition, despite histological and clinical differences. The recognition of COPD as a systemic disease that affects extra-pulmonary systems, including cardiovascular, sleep and muscle function, further complicates disease classification. Because of clinical and pathological heterogeneity, individual patient subtypes may benefit from unique therapeutic regimens. Thus the SPIROMICS study was initiated to facilitate the identification of important COPD phenotypes, based on disease pathophysiology and biomarkers that track key pathophysiologic processes, in order to focus research efforts and improve treatment options.","","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema","The SPIROMICS study sought to identify homogeneous subgroups of COPD patients for targeted enrollment in future therapeutic clinical trials, as well as to identify and conduct preliminary validation of intermediate biological or clinical outcomes for use as clinical trial endpoints.","Eligible participants were between 40 and 80 years of age, and included never-smokers, current and former smokers without obstructive lung disease, and current and former smokers with COPD.  Never smoker was defined as less than 1 pack-year smoking history, and current or former smoker were defined as more than 20 pack-years smoking history. Lung function was also part of the eligibility criteria and was assessed by spirometry with or without inhaled bronchodilators. Non-smokers were required to have pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second)/FVC (forced vital capacity) > 0.7 and FVC > LLN (lower limit of normal). Current or former smokers without obstructive lung disease were required to have post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC > 0.7 and FVC > LLN. Current or former smokers with obstructive lung disease were required to have post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 and FEV1 > 50% predicted.

Major exclusion criteria included non-COPD obstructive lung disease or a history of diseases or treatments likely to interfere with interpretation of study tests, BMI > 40 kg/m2 at baseline, hypersensitivity to or intolerance of the bronchodilators used in study assessments, and diagnosis of unstable cardiovascular disease."
"CAPTION","Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians to Improve Outcomes Now (CAPTION)","Chronically elevated blood pressure and asthma are two conditions, when uncontrolled, can lead to serious complications, often requiring hospitalization and extensive medical interventions. If detected early and managed properly, hospital visits are reduced and medical costs are better contained. For a variety of reasons though, asthma and blood pressure control are not always achieved by community level, primary-care physicians making hospital visits unavoidable.
  
Previous studies indicate that when a pharmacist is part of a community physician practice, patients have better BP control than those whose primary care team does not include a pharmacist. This PPCM approach to patient care allows pharmacists to have a more active role by assisting with the screening, education, and medication management of hypertensive patients.","Although there was not a significant difference between the control and intervention groups within the initial 9-month period of the study, sustained blood pressure reduction was evident for minority and white participants in intervention groups even after interventions were discontinued. These findings suggest that the physician/pharmacist collaborative approach to blood pressure control is beneficial when implemented in primary care offices with greater racial diversity.

The primary outcome for all patients in the asthma study was also negative but for patients in the PPCM group who were identified as having uncontrolled asthma at baseline, a significant reduction in the number ED visits and hospitalizations was evident.","Asthma, Hypertension","Using a physician/pharmacist collaborative management (PPCM) approach to patient care, the CAPTION study investigated if blood pressure (BP) control of ethnically diverse and geographically distributed populations, could be better managed. In an asthma sub-study, researchers also investigated if using a PPCM approach could reduce the number of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations.","Hypertension study:  625 participants were enrolled in the CAPTION study. Enrollees were male or female, 18 years of age or older, and had a diagnosis of hypertension. Fifty-four percent of participants were from racial/ethnic minority groups and 50% also had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease (CKD). To qualify, participants needed to have a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of greater than 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of greater than 90 mm Hg.  Participants with diabetes or CKD could qualify with a SBP of greater than 130 or a DBP greater than 80. Disqualifying factors included pregnancy, history of MI, stroke or unstable angina 6 months prior to enrollment, severe hypertension (SBP >200 or DBP > 114 mm Hg), or an ejection fraction (EF) < 35%.  Those with pulmonary HTN, sleep apnea, or cognitive impairment were also excluded from enrollment.

Asthma study: 126 male or female participants, ages 12 or older, with a diagnosis of asthma were enrolled in the study. Patients with severe asthma, who had a history of needing mechanical ventilation, or were likely to be managed by a pulmonologist were excluded. A diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pregnancy, or cognitive impairment were additional disqualifiers."
"HFN-EXACT HF","Heart Failure Network (HFN) Xanthine Oxidase Inhibition for Hyperuricemic Heart Failure Patients (EXACT HF)","Morbidity and mortality rates for patients with heart failure are high, despite guideline-recommended therapy. Heart failure is characterized by an imbalance between left ventricular (LV) performance and myocardial energy consumption. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests oxidative stress contributes to ventricular and vascular remodeling, and disease progression in heart failure. Targeting potential source(s) of oxidative stress, e.g. Xanthine oxidase (XO), was the focus of recent clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Increased XO activity has been shown to lead to production of superoxide and uric acid (UA). Serum uric acid levels are included in heart failure risk scores, and hyperuricemia is present in about 25% of patients with heart failure. Hyperuricemia is associated with exercise intolerance, reduced survival, and worsening symptoms.  The EXACT-HF trial tested allopurinol, an inhibitor of XO, as a potential target therapy for hyperuricemic heart failure patients.","Participants who received allopurinol had significantly less serum uric acid laboratory levels after 24 weeks; however, no significant difference was observed in the primary and secondary endpoints between the allopurinol and placebo-treated patients. Therefore, in high-risk HF patients with reduced ejection fraction and elevated uric acid levels, xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol failed to improve clinical status, exercise capacity, quality of life, or LVEF at 24 weeks.

Circulation. 2015 May 19; 131(20):1763-71","Heart Failure, Elevated Serum Uric Acid","To determine the effect of allopurinol after 24 weeks on a composite clinical endpoint that classifies subject’s clinical status (improved, worsened, unchanged) in patients with heart failure and high uric acid levels.","253 subjects were enrolled in the EXACT-HF study. 128 participants were randomized to the allopurinol arm, and of those participants, 119 completed the trial and 9 did not. 125 participants were randomized to the placebo arm, and of those participants, 116 completed the trial and 9 did not.

Adult patients from both sexes were eligible for the EXACT-HF study. The participants must have been diagnosed with NYHA class II-IV heart failure due to ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% by echocardiography and heart failure symptoms for 3 months despite standard treatment, serum uric acid level ≥ 9.5 mg/dl, and at least one of the following additional markers of increased risk: hospitalization, ER visit or urgent clinic visit for heart failure requiring IV diuretics within the previous 12 months; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 25; B-type natriuretic peptide level > 250 pg/ml."
"HIT RADIO","Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia - Retrospective Analysis of Data on Incidence and Outcomes Study (HIT-RADIO)","Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a common and often severe complication of heparin therapy. HIT is an immunologic drug reaction mediated by the IgG antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex. Thrombocytopenia is the cardinal, yet least worrisome, complication of HIT. The major complications are arterial and venous thrombi. Patients who are positive for thrombosis and a heparin-PF4 antibody test, with or without thrombocytopenia, categorize further as HIT-Thrombosis (HIT-T). Conversely, patients with no clinical evidence for thrombosis, but positive for thrombocytopenia and heparin-PF4 antibody test are clinically categorized as isolated HIT.

The incidence of HIT ranges from 0.3-5.0%, and is dependent on population, type and route of heparin used. The treatment of HIT-T with anticoagulation is well established, but the risks and treatment of isolated HIT are unclear. Recent ACCP (“CHEST”) current standard of care guidelines for isolated HIT is the institution of a direct thrombin inhibitor until the platelet count is greater than 100,000 (usually for 3-4 days), the overlap of the direct thrombin inhibitor with Coumadin for at least 5 days, and an unspecified total duration of anticoagulation (although 28 days from the onset of this complication is often recommended). These guidelines are based upon a sparse amount of data, with no randomized placebo-controlled studies, and few prospective studies. Unfortunately, treatment of isolated HIT often results in major increases in hospital length of stays, and financial obligations.

An observational study, HOT, Heparin-Induced  Thrombocytopenia Observational Thromboembolism Study, was designed to address the incidence of isolated HIT, and whether such patients had an increased rate of symptomatic or asymptomatic clots. The study was unsuccessful due to shortcomings in the number of eligible subjects identified with isolated HIT. Nevertheless, a large cohort of consecutive patients with a positive heparin-PF4 antibody test were identified. The HIT-RADIO study would be the largest multi-site retrospective study of this patient population in many years.  The intent of this study was to obtain large samples of positive heparin-PF4 antibody subjects to perform specific, descriptive, and hypothesis-generating outcomes.","The statistical analysis of the primary composite triple endpoint was measured by the mean time to occurrence.  The mean time to the primary endpoint for subjects with HIT-T was 17.5 days; for subjects with Isolated HIT was 27.8 days; and for subjects with No HIT was 31.4 days.  This difference in time to the primary outcome was found to be statistically significant when comparing subjects with HIT-T to those with No HIT, but was not significant when comparing subjects with Isolated HIT to those with No HIT.","Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia","To determine the time to occurrence of a composite triple endpoint (death, limb amputation/gangrene, and new thrombosis) after a positive heparin PF-4 antibody test.","Subjects were a combination of participants from the previous HOT Study  and/or any patients at selected hospitals associated with the Transfusion Medicine/Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network. Approximately 500 patients were estimated to be enrolled in the study.

A positive heparin-PF4 antibody test occurred in 668 patients. Of those 668 patients, 442 were eligible subjects and 226 were excluded due to lack of recent heparin exposure. Eligible subjects were further divided into three reporting groups: HIT-T (71), Isolated HIT (284), and No HIT (87).

In order to be included in this study, the medical record had to be available for the hospital admission when the positive heparin-PF4 antibody test was obtained. No exclusion criteria were recorded."
"BMT CTN-0603","Blood and Marrow Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) Bone Marrow Transplant From Partially Matched Donors and Nonmyeloablative Conditioning for Blood Cancers (0603)","Individuals with aggressive forms of the blood cancers leukemia and lymphoma typically receive targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation as part of their treatment options. When these and other therapies have been exhausted, it is recommended that the patient receive a bone marrow or cord blood transplant. A first degree relative, if available, is likely to be the best candidate as a bone marrow donor if the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers are a sufficient match.

For recipients who find a suitable match, high doses of chemotherapy are administered preemptively in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of transplant rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Often though, individuals greater than 60 years of age or with multiple medical conditions are disqualified from the regimen due to their inability to withstand the chemotherapeutic agents’ toxicity levels.

The BMT CTN 0603, or Haplo-marrow trial, researched the effectiveness of a type of bone marrow transplant called reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) or nonmyeloablative transplant for individuals who were only a partial or haploidentical match with a family member. Specifically, recipients were given lower doses of chemotherapy prior to receiving the transplant and also received a smaller quantity of transplanted bone marrow than is typically administered. 

The BMT CTN 0603 study was one of two parallel multicenter phase 2 studies; the other of which was <a href=""https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/bmt_0604/"">BMT CTN 0604</a>, which used double umbilical cord blood transplantation. The goal of these studies was to generate pilot multicenter data to support a future phase 3 randomized clinical trial.","Of the 50 participants in the BMT CTN 0603 study, 83.7% survived to the 6-month benchmark and 62.0% survived to the 1-year benchmark. Neutrophil recovery at day +56 was 96%, platelet recovery at day +100 was 98%, treatment related mortality was 4% at 6 months, and there was one case of primary graft failure.

Outcomes from both clinical trials suggest that the rates of survivorship are comparable to those where there was a matched unrelated donor.

"SOYA","The Study of Soy Isoflavones in Asthma (SOYA)","The prevalence of asthma is determined by multiple environmental and genetic factors, and over the last several decades, both the prevalence and severity of asthma have increased. Specific causes remain unknown, but diet is one of the environmental factors associated with increased prevalence and severity.

Previous studies had shown that those who consume soy isoflavones have better lung function compared to those who do not. The study focused on two particular iosflavones, genistein and daidzein, based on the strong preclinical and epidemiological data that supported the prediction of beneficial dietary effects for asthma patients. At the cellular level, genistein exerts antioxidant effects that are equal to or greater than those of vitamin C. Prior to the clinical trial, recent in vitro results showed that genistein inhibits synthesis of human peripheral blood eosinophil cysteinyl leukotrienes via inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase. Synthesis of the eosinophil cysteinyl leukotrienes is a key pathways that may contribute to asthma severity.","Participants who received the soy isoflavone supplement exhibited an increase in mean plasma genistein levels; however, no clinically significant improvement was observed in the primary end point of FEV1 at 24 weeks post-randomization between participants treated with soy isoflavone supplement and placebo.

JAMA. 2015 May 26;313(20):2033-43","Asthma","To determine whether participants with poorly controlled asthma have improved asthma control and lung capacity when prescribed a soy isoflavone supplement versus a placebo.","Eligible participants were over the age of 12, of either gender, and were non-smokers for 6 months or longer with a less than 10 pack-year smoking history. The SOYA trial had 193 participants randomized into the placebo and soy isoflavone arms for a total of 386 participants. 179 participants in the placebo arm and 166 participants in the soy isoflavone arm completed the trial, which was defined as having an FEV1 measurement at 24 weeks.

Participants were included if they had been diagnosed by a physician with asthma, were currently prescribed daily controller asthma medication, or had a FEV1 equal or greater than 50% predicted pre-bronchodilator and/or at least 12% increase in FEV1 15-3 minutes after inhaling 2-4 puffs of albuterol or positive methacholine challenge (20% fall in FEV1 at less than 8 mg/mL) with either parameter available from the previous two years.

"REDS II-Chagas","Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II (REDS II) Natural History of Disease and Laboratory Findings in Trypanosoma Cruzi Antibody-Positive Brazilian Blood Donors (Chagas)","Since 1989, the NHLBI has sponsored epidemiologic, laboratory, and survey research in the field of blood supply safety and transfusion research through the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) program. In 2006, the program initiated international components in Brazil and China to extend the scope of blood safety research as part of the REDS-II program. In Brazil, Chagas disease was one of the public health concerns addressed by the REDS-II program. Chagas disease is caused by the parasite <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>. <i>T cruzi</i> transmits via hematophagous triatomine insects (“kissing bugs”), but can transmit vertically during pregnancy, peripartum, blood transfusion, or organ transplantation.

In the endemic regions of Brazil, the majority of patients with acute Chagas disease were asymptomatic and most symptomatic patients presented with only minor clinical manifestations. The natural history of Chagas was poorly understood and therefore, counseling of asymptomatic seropositive patients was difficult. Furthering this difficulty was a lack of clinical predictors for severe clinical presentation of Chagas disease that could guide early treatment. As a result, cardiologists in Brazil refrained from treating asymptomatic patients due to the combination of uncertain prognosis and the toxicity of antitrypanosomal drugs.

This study presents the results from a large, retrospective cohort study with an average follow up of eleven years. The purpose of this study was to characterize the natural history of clinical Chagas disease, measure disease penetrance, and determine prognostic factors of Chagas cardiomyopathy among asymptomatic <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>-infected persons identified 10 years ago.","Among the 499 ,<i>T cruzi</i> seropositive subjects, 120 (24%) had definite Chagas cardiomyopathy, and among the 488 <i>T cruzi</i> seronegative subjects, 24 (5%) had cardiomyopathy, for an incidence rate of 1.85 per 100 person-years attributable to <i>T cruzi</i> infection. The false-positive diagnoses of Chagas-like cardiomyopathy among 5% of the <i>T cruzi</i> seronegative subjects illustrate the difficulty in distinguishing Chagas from other cardiac diseases, which can lead to overestimation of incidence in uncontrolled seropositive cohorts.  Potential prognostic factors for Chagas cardiomyopathy, if confirmed in other studies, include male sex, a history of ECG abnormalities, and S3 gallop.

Seropositive and seronegative donors were obtained from two blood donations centers in Brazil: Sao Paulo and Montes Claros. Seropositive blood donors were screened between 1998 and 2002 and confirmed positive for the <i>T cruzi</i> antibody at the time of donation. In Sao Paulo, screenings for the <i>T cruzi</i> antibody consisted of three (3) serological methods: ELISA, hemaglutination, and immunofluorescence. Only donors reactive to all three (3) assays at the time of donation were considered eligible for the study. In Montes Claros, ELISA and hemaglutination assays were utilized to screen donors. Only donors reactive to both assays at the time of donation were considered eligible for the study. Seronegative donors were matched to each seropositive donor by year of index donation, site, age, and sex.

There were 511 seropositive and 504 seronegative blood donors enrolled in the study. Of these, a total of 499 seropositive and 488 seronegative blood donors had complete data and were submitted for the expert panel review process. Among the 499 seropositive donors with complete data, 315 were referred to the expert panel and 120 were classified as Chagas cardiomyopathy. Among the 488 seronegative donors with complete data, 232 were referred to the expert panel and 24 were classified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy.

In addition, 101 previously diagnosed cases of Chagas cardiomyopathy from the Heart Institute of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School were included in the study to assess the sensitivity of cardiac outcomes measurements. The inclusion criteria for validation cases were: physician diagnosis of Chagas cardiomyopathy, no previous treatment of benznidazole, and no comorbidity (diabetes, hypertension, or renal failure).  Of these cases, 101 were referred to the expert panel and 99 were classified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy by the expert panel."
"CPAP","Effect of Positive Airway Pressure on Reducing Airway Reactivity in Patients With Asthma (CPAP)","Asthma is characterized by an increase in airways smooth muscle constriction to non-specific agonists and hyper-responsiveness to stimulation of airway constriction. Current therapies, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting bronchodilators (beta-agonists), address inflammation and increased airway tone. Limitation of current therapies are cost, adherence, and concerns about long-term use.

Airway smooth muscle tissue requires intermittent stretching-dilation and constriction. In the absence of dilation, airways smooth muscle tissue may alter its contractile properties to continue to perform its role. This is supported by the maintenance of elevated end-expiratory lung volume (FRC) through tonic contraction of respiratory muscles in asthmatics. FRC is reduced during sleep resulting in decreased dilation of airways from lack of deep inspiration. Low FRC may account for some unexplained characteristics of asthma, notably the worsening of symptoms in the morning, and the inability of deep inspiration to dilate airways and reverse bronchoconstriction.

Providing a conceptual basis for a novel treatment of asthma that does not rely on pharmacologic modulation of inflammation or bronchoconstriction was the focus of this trial. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) increases stretching of the airways during sleep and prevents a fall in FRC that could lead to closure of airways in dependent regions of the lung. CPAP has been widely and safely used for the treatment of sleep apnea and demonstrated to be effective in reducing airway activity in previous trials on animals and humans. Therefore an imperative of the trial was to determine whether the effect of CPAP could be reproduced and sustained for a longer time.","Adherence to nocturnal CPAP was low for all groups, with the sham group having the best adherence. All treatment arms experienced significant improvement in the primary endpoint, however the improvements between the active and sham treatment arms were not found to be statistically significant. Therefore there was no evidence to support positive pressure as being effective for reducing airway reactivity in people with well-controlled asthma.

"BEST-COPD","Broccoli Sprouts Extracts Trial (BEST-COPD)","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), caused primarily by smoking, is the third leading cause of death in the United States and world-wide. Surprisingly, there are few treatments available to address the pathobiology of COPD other than cessation of smoking. The development and progression of COPD are associated with increased inflammatory response(s) and increased oxidative stress in the lung. Thus, one approach to the development of novel therapies is the stimulation of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms.

Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor activated by oxidative stress. Nrf2 activity promotes anti-oxidant enzymes, and anti-oxidant enzymes play key roles in cellular defenses. Sulforaphane, a derivative of broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to stimulate Nrf2 activity in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. For example, activation of Nrf2 protected mice from developing emphysema after chronic smoke exposure and decreased oxidative stress. Similarly, activation of Nrf2 in human COPD lung cells resulted in decreased oxidative stress. Therefore, this study was designed to assess whether daily ingestion of sulforaphane by COPD patients for four weeks increased Nrf2 activity in alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells.","Sulforaphane administered at four weeks doses of 25umoles and 150umoles to patients with COPD did not significantly increase Nrf2 target gene expression in alveolar macrophages or bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, changes in oxidative stress markers and the expression of other genes in the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway were not statistically significant between the treatment groups.

"PLADO","Determination of the Optimal Prophylactic Platelet Dose Strategy to Prevent Bleeding in Thrombocytopenic Patients (PLADO)","The optimal number of platelets in a prophylactic platelet transfusion is controversial. Platelet transfusions are costly, and require effective management for current and future supply needs. Furthermore, platelets transfusions have multiple severe, and potentially fatal, adverse outcomes. Current guidelines for a standard adult dose are approximately 3x1011 to 6x1011 platelets. Higher doses than the current guidelines are likely to result in superior hemostasis. Conversely, dosages lower than the current guidelines might be equally effective at achieving hemostasis, but more effective for cost and supply management. Previous trials with limited enrollment compared a low platelet dosage to the standard dosage. In both trials, there was no significant difference found between the dosages for prevention of bleeding.

The PLADO trial was conducted to better understand the effects of platelets dosage in prophylactic transfusion on clinical signs of bleeding, the use of platelet and red-cell transfusions, changes in the recipient’s post-transfusion platelet count, days to next transfusion, and adverse events.","Platelet doses between 1.1 x 1011/m² and 4.4 x 1011/m² had no significant effect on the incidence of bleeding in patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. However, patients had a 25% risk of having grade 2 or higher bleeding on days on which the morning platelet count was 5,000/mL3 or lower, as compared with a 17% risk on days with counts of 6,000-80,000 /mL3. Additionally, the low platelet transfusion dose led to a decreased number of platelets transfused per patient, but an increased number of transfusions given.

"BRIDGE","Bridging Anticoagulation in Patients Who Require Temporary Interruption of Warfarin Therapy for an Elective Invasive Procedure or Surgery (BRIDGE)","Approximately one in six warfarin–treated patients with atrial fibrillation will undergo an elective operation or other elective invasive procedure, which requires perioperative interruption of warfarin treatment in order to reduce the risk of major bleeding. Multiple observational studies have assessed the timing and dosing of perioperative bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH); however, the fundamental question of whether bridging anticoagulation is necessary during perioperative warfarin interruption has remained unanswered. As a result, there was insufficient evidence for practice guidelines which created weak and inconsistent recommendations regarding the need for bridging anticoagulation.

The BRIDGE trial was designed to address a simple question: in patients with atrial fibrillation, is heparin bridging needed during interruption of warfarin therapy before and after an operation or other invasive procedure? The primary efficacy outcomes were arterial thromboembolism, including stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolism, and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The secondary efficacy outcomes were acute myocardial infarction, deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death, and the secondary safety outcome was minor bleeding.","The incidence of arterial thromboembolism was 0.4% in the placebo group and 0.3% and the dalteparin group. Major bleeding occurred in 1.3% of the placebo group and 3.2% of the dalteparin group. The risk of minor bleeding was significantly lower in the placebo group than in the dalteparin group. There were no significant differences between the groups in secondary efficacy outcomes. In conclusion, discontinuing warfarin treatment without the use of bridging anticoagulation was noninferior to the use of bridging anticoagulation.

"GHCoE-New Delhi","Global Health Centers of Excellence (GHCoE) New Delhi","Cardio-metabolic diseases (CMDs) include diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and common risk factors that underlie these conditions such as central obesity, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. CMDs are a growing global public health problem, with high mortality rates particularly in low- and middle-income countries. However, CMDs have the advantage of being predictable through identification of risk factors and also preventable through changes in lifestyle, particularly through healthy eating habits and regular physical activity. The greatest gains in prevention have been seen when early and target-driven interventions address multiple risk factors. However, achieving control of individual risk factors is poor, globally. Quality improvement schemes have shown promise in high-income countries, but were untested in South Asia at the time of these studies.

In people of South Asian origin, diabetes, and CMD risk factors and events occur at younger ages and lower body mass indices when compared to other ethnic groups, and are rapidly increasing with socioeconomic and nutrition transitions. CVD is currently the leading cause of death in both urban and rural India. Prior to these studies, the major source of population level estimates of CMD risk factors, morbidity and mortality in India was ad hoc surveys. Such methods are limited by problems of sample design, lack of standardization, frequent measurement errors and incomplete reporting of results.

"GHCoE-Argentina","Global Health Centers of Excellence (GHCoE) Argentina","Protocol 1
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) represent a growing and global health burden, particularly in economically developing countries. Although age-adjusted rates for CVD mortality have diminished in developed countries, rates have increased in low and middle-income countries reaching 80% of the global burden of disease. The strategies to manage CVDs have largely been developed for populations in high-income countries that are therefore of limited utility in the majority of developing countries. Regardless, there is strong evidence of reducing CVD mortality by modifying three risk factors: smoking, arterial hypertension and high cholesterol. In addition, most CVD occurrence can be explained by other more proximal risk factors such as unhealthy diet, low physical activity and tobacco. COPD incidence in developing countries is largely tied to tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke, as well as poor indoor and outdoor air quality.

The Southern Cone is a geographic and cultural region in Latin America generally consisting of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, which share similar socio-demographic characteristics. At the time of this study, there had been no longitudinal studies related to the incidence of chronic diseases and risk factors in this region of Latin America. Thus, the understanding of local needs and the data necessary to determine the burden of CVD and COPD, as well as the stratification of risk factors and the identification of management strategies on a population level, were limited. To fill this knowledge gap, the CESCAS I study was intended to generate more precise estimates of the incidence, distribution, and risk factors of CVD and COPD in the southern cone of Latin America.

Protocol 2
Globally about 3 billion people depend on solid fuels for cooking, with 3% of that population living in developing countries from Latin America and the Caribbean. Most households in developing countries use wood as their primary cooking fuel and only 5% of the users of biomass fuels for cooking have access to clean cooking stoves. Preliminary data of PRISA, a population-based cohort study conducted in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, showed an average exposure to IAP between 21% in Bariloche and 26% in Temuco.

Acute respiratory infections (ARI) represent a common cause of illness in children younger than five years of age in Latin American countries and 12% of deaths for this age group are estimated to be caused by pneumonia. The reduction of IAP related to the use of solid fuels for cooking has been identified as a potential intervention for preventing pneumonia in children. In addition, adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as prematurity or low birth weight, have been linked to exposure to secondhand smoke and ambient air pollution","","Prematurity, Lower Respiratory Tract Infections, Acute Respiratory Infections, Indoor Air Pollution, Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes, Cardiovascular Diseases, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","Protocol 1

"TACT","Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT)","Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death among men and women in the United States. In addition to following the standard medical advice of incorporating healthy lifestyle choices such as a heart healthy diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, patients may receive chelation therapy as a means to reduce cardiovascular plaque and the complications associated with it.

Historically, chelation therapy involves injecting EDTA into the bloodstream where it binds to toxic agents such as heavy metals and/or minerals, and eliminates them from the body via urinary excretion. Built on this premise, it was believed that chelation therapy could reduce calcium buildup, a mineral and primary contributor to the formation of vascular plaque. Although, chelation therapy with disodium EDTA has been used in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease for more than 50 years, there have not been controlled trials to support or refute its efficacy for improving clinical outcomes. Therefore patients are exposed to uncertain risks for unproven benefits. In addition, The FDA removed edetate disodium from the market in 2008, after the initiation of the TACT trial.

As another approach, diets rich in a mix of antioxidants and other micronutrients are associated with lower rates of atherosclerosis. However, clinical trials have not been able to replicate the benefits and have assessed only a small number of the vitamins and minerals present in multivitamin and multimineral supplements.","Reduction of mortality was not statistically significant for patients receiving chelation therapy but it was noted that the trial had low statistical power for this evaluation. Chelation therapy for stable patients with a history of MI showed modest improvement in the reduction of non-fatal cardiovascular events but the results were not significant enough to recommend its routine use and further research may be warranted.

High-dose oral multivitamins and multiminerals did not produce a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with a history of MI. The results were limited by the relatively high rate of participant non-compliance.

"GHCoE-China","Global Health Centers of Excellence (GHCoE) China","Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with particular burden in low and middle income countries highlighting the need for effective interventions that are affordable, applicable and effective in these settings. In particular, clinical guidelines recommend a combined strategy of lifestyle modifications and appropriate medication use for CVD prevention and control in individuals at high CVD risk. However, further evidence is needed to evaluate the population benefits from implementing these high risk strategies, particularly in resource poor settings where targeting high risk individuals could be a cost effective approach.

<u>Protocol 1</u>
Rural China is underdeveloped and has more limited healthcare resources compared to urban areas. The lowest level healthcare facility is the village clinic which typically serves a population between 300 and 2,500 residents. The primary care health services are provided by “village doctors” who are not qualified physicians by Western standards but are healthcare workers with limited medical training, basic equipment and a restricted pharmacopeia. Strategies that enable this workforce to deliver appropriate cardiovascular care to those at high risk have the potential to reduce the disease burden in these resource poor settings.

Stroke is the leading cause of death in China. Excess sodium intake is a key determinant of high blood pressure, the leading cause of stroke. China, especially in the rural areas, has one of the highest sodium intake levels in the world mainly from salt added in cooking and condiments at home. The substitution of salt with an alternate product lower in sodium may provide the opportunity to deliver a large public health benefit at low cost. Beneficial effects of salt substitution on urinary electrolytes and blood pressure have been achieved in randomized trials done in selected populations including those in rural China, but whether effects can be achieved in the general community was unknown at the time of the study. 

<u>Protocol 2</u>
China and India face similar challenges and opportunities in CVD prevention and control such as the rising CVD burden, large urban-rural health disparities, limited resources and capacity, a large population base, and increasing access to mobile phones. Previous studies have shown that there are significant improvements in accessing healthcare facilities, disease screening and monitoring, and patients’ adherence to treatment by engaging community healthcare workers (CHWs). The high penetration of cell phones even in resource poor settings offers an unprecedented opportunity to provide support to CHWs. Therefore, the SimCard study aimed to develop and evaluate a simplified yet guideline-based multifaceted intervention program for CVD management of high risk individuals delivered by CHWs with the aid of a mobile technology based electronic decision support system.","<u>Protocol 1</u>
Results are not yet published for the Primary Care Provider project. For the Sodium Reduction Study, the intervention villages showed significant decreases in urinary sodium excretion, decreases in the urinary sodium to potassium ratio, and increases in urinary potassium as compared to control villages, most likely due to increased use of the salt substitute. The use of the salt substitute in villages with a subsidy was almost twice that of villages without the price subsidy. Intervention effects on blood pressure were modest, but non-significant.

"HHL","Heart Healthy Lenoir Project (HHL)","Strokes and cardiovascular disease share many of the same risk factors, namely, elevated blood pressure, a sedentary lifestyle, and a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25. Southeast regions of the United States are commonly referred to as the ‘stroke belt’ because there are more stroke related deaths and risk factors for developing CVD. The area is also characterized as having greater socioeconomic and racial disparities, less access to quality healthcare, and lower educational levels. In particular, blacks living in the southeast, have disproportionately less blood pressure control than their white counterparts and residents of Lenoir County have higher rates of poverty than national averages.

Reducing CVD risk factors is multifaceted and partially achievable through modifiable lifestyle patterns such as healthier dietary choices and increased physical activity. Additionally, access to healthcare and culturally appropriate healthcare education are believed to positively influence adherence to medications and overall health outcomes. In these studies, a community-based approach was used to design and develop better methods to manage obesity and hypertension and in the process, aimed to reduce the prevalence of CVD in high risk populations.","At enrollment and throughout the study, there was no evidence of a racial disparity for BP control between blacks and whites. Compared to other studies though, the High BP study enrolled more black male participants; a group that is often underrepresented in research.

"ROC-CCC","Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Trial Of Continuous Compressions Versus Standard CPR In Patients With Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (CCC)","Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) consists of manual chest compressions to maintain blood flow and positive-pressure ventilation to maintain oxygenation until spontaneous circulation is restored. Chest compressions during standard CPR are interrupted frequently by ventilations. These interruptions reduce blood flow and potentially reduce the effectiveness of CPR. In animals with cardiac arrest, the interruption of chest compressions has been associated with decreased survival. Observational studies involving humans with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause have suggested that continuous compressions are associated with higher rates of survival than interrupted compressions.","During the active-enrollment phase, 1129 of 12,613 patients in the continuous chest compression group and 1072 of 11,035 patients in the interrupted chest compressions group survived to hospital discharge.

"GHCoE-South Africa","Global Health Centers of Excellence (GHCoE) South Africa","Protocol 1
Chronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and certain cancers, have steadily emerged, along with mental health conditions, as major threats to health across the spectrum of Sub-Saharan Africa’s diverse racial, ethnic and social class groupings. Multiple studies in this population have shown that the common risk factors and associated elements of an unhealthy lifestyle are often undiagnosed and inadequately treated. This is especially true in public sector community health centers upon which the majority of the impoverished population rely on. The Chronic Disease Initiative in Africa proposes an integrated model for primary care of chronic disease based on World Health Organization recommendations. The goal of which is to strengthen and broaden the health care team by providing tools that improve the effectiveness of care and by mobilizing community support and patient involvement in their own care. This study addressed several aspects of this model.

Given the large global burden of CVD and very limited resources in developing countries, finding low cost prevention strategies is a top priority. In developed country cohorts, non-lab screening mechanisms have been used to predict risk of future CVD events as effectively as screenings that require blood testing. Thus, this study sought to continue with the development of a simple risk prediction tool for CVD and to assess its effectiveness in a South African cohort.

The Practical Approach to Lung Health and HIV/AIDS in South Africa (PALSA PLUS) uniquely combines educational outreach, or brief onsite interactive education, with symptom-based guidelines. The program has been embedded in the South African healthcare system and shown to be effective for case management of patients with respiratory diseases and HIV/AIDS. Thus, this study sought to extend the program and evaluate if it would be effective for other major categories of chronic diseases. Furthermore, an economic evaluation model is necessary to project the implications, at both the individual and societal levels, of changes in risk factors resulting from such a program. Given that resources are limited, cost effective analysis can help compare the relative value of different options in improving the quality or length of life in order to maximize the health benefit for a given expenditure.

Protocol 2
Effective screening and appropriate management of patients who are at high risk for chronic disease in low resource settings is difficult to accomplish due to limited levels of trained personnel and limited financial resources to conduct lab-based assessments. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are important for promoting health in low socioeconomic populations, but utilization of CHWs in many low and middle income countries (LMICs) has been largely focused on infectious disease management and maternal and child health. Furthermore, the effectiveness of CHWs in screening for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and referral for those at high CVD risk for care at primary health centers, has not been evaluated in LMICs. Therefore this study investigated whether training CHWs to use a non-lab based CVD risk screening tool could serve as a model for improving patient care and reducing the burden on health personnel in LMICs.","","Cardiovascular Diseases","Protocol 1

There is also evidence that longer durations of VF or VT are associated with decreases in the likelihood of resuscitation. Amiodarone and lidocaine are commonly used to promote successful defibrillation of shock-refractory VF or VT and prevent recurrences. Previous trials have shown amiodarone to be more effective than placebo or lidocaine for return of spontaneous circulation and survival at hospital admittance. This study sought to further extend the research and examine whether amiodarone would improve survival to hospital discharge and neurologic outcomes, as compared to placebo or lidocaine.","Neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival to hospital discharge or favorable neurologic outcome, as compared to placebo, among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.

In addition to functional stress tests, CTA is another noninvasive test that has significantly higher accuracy and the ability to detect nonobstructive CAD. Therefore CTA has the potential to reduce unnecessary invasive testing and improve outcomes. However, at the time of this study, there were limited data regarding health related outcomes of the various noninvasive tests in order to identify which would be preferred in patient care, particularly for populations at very low risk. Therefore PROMISE sought to evaluate the effectiveness of noninvasive anatomical testing versus functional testing on subsequent care management and clinical outcomes.","In symptomatic patients with suspected CAD who required noninvasive testing, a strategy of initial CTA, as compared with functional testing, did not improve clinical outcomes over a median follow-up of two years.

"GHCoE-Guatemala","Global Health Centers of Excellence (GHCoE) Guatemala","Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) present a significant and growing public health burden, particularly in developing countries, and are the leading cause of death in adults in Mesoamerica. Risk can be significantly reduced through the modification of lifestyle, diet, and physical activity. 

<u>Protocol 1</u>
In the Mesoamerican region, diet factors associated with CVD risk include deficiency in alpha-linolenic acid, low consumption of legumes, increased use of palm oil in cooking, increased intake of refined grains and cereals, and deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids. In addition, obesity rates for both children and adults continue to rise. This study sought to establish a reference point for the prevalence of CVD diet related risk factors in Mesoamerican countries in order to facilitate interventions that improve diet quality and increase physical activity.

<u>Protocol 2</u>
Encouraging a healthy lifestyle at an early age before food and lifestyle preferences are solidified is critical to CVD prevention, especially in urban and impoverished communities which suffer from nutritional disparities. However, data regarding physical activity patterns and other risk factors in children are limited, and most school- and home-based interventions have failed to prevent childhood obesity. Therefore, this study sought to develop and test a socio-ecologic intervention model for the improvement of diet and physical activity patterns in elementary school-age children from urban settings in Guatemala as a tool for CVD prevention in a manner appropriate to the population’s specific needs and culture. This was established in three phases: (1) collection of baseline and formative research data for such a model, (2) collection of information on the status of CVD risk factors and how premature the damage is established, and (3) development of a community-based intervention that is feasible, culturally acceptable and effective in promoting healthy behaviors in school-age children.

<u>Protocol 3</u>
CVD prevention is especially important in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or high blood pressure. Adherence to treatment and lifestyle changes can reduce CVD risk. This study focused on intervention at the primary healthcare center and community level using a CVD risk prevention model originally developed in Guatemala.

<u>Protocol 4</u>
Pre-hypertensive individuals are at high risk of progression to hypertension and developing CVD. Early interventions to increase the practice of healthy lifestyles in these high-risk individuals could reduce blood pressure, decrease the rate of progression to hypertension, or prevent hypertension entirely. However, primary care systems in developing countries often lack comprehensive prevention, screening, and management programs directed to pre-hypertensive individuals.

The use of mobile technologies is emerging as a useful tool for the healthcare system in the developing world given the limitations in the workforce, financial resources, high burden of disease paired with high population group, and difficult to reach populations. Developed countries have used mobile health to promote weight loss, physical activity, and smoking cessation. Therefore, this protocol sought to examine the effectiveness of mobile health contact in Latin America.","","Diabetes Mellitus, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Obesity, Cardiovascular Diseases, Chronic Cardio Metabolic Diseases, Hypertension","<u>Protocol 1</u>

Eligible participants included children aged 7 to 12 and their parents. The study sought to recruit at least 30 families from each of 9 Mesoamerican countries: Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. About 20 children were randomly selected from each of four peri-urban schools in the capital of each country. Children were then excluded from the study if they did not live with both parents, were pregnant or had a pregnant mother, or had a sibling already included in the study.

<u>Protocol 2</u>
Phase 1: The target population consisted of children 9 to 12 years of age enrolled in low-income urban elementary schools from three urban municipalities around Guatemala City (Villa Nueva, Santa Catarina Pinula, and Mixco). About 50 children and their parents were to be randomly selected from four public and two private schools for focus group discussions. Home visits were further performed for up to 30 families (5 per school) of focus group participants.

Phase 2: The target population consisted of children 6 to 12 years of age enrolled in five low-income urban elementary schools from the communities of San Jose La Comunidad and Municipality of Mixco in the Guatemala City area. The study aimed to enroll 96 healthy children, with 48 being of normal weight (BMI z score < +1) and 48 being overweight (BMI z score > +1). Exclusion criteria included chronic illness, menarche, siblings already in the study, and being underweight.

Phase 3: The target population consisted of children 9 to 12 years of age enrolled in two low-income urban public schools located within the Municipality of Mixco, and their mothers. All students in the grade and their parents were exposed to the intervention, but only a randomly selected sample of 120 child/mother pairs (60 per school) were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the intervention. Exclusion criteria included children with long-term restrictions for physical activities, siblings already in the study, and a child with a pregnant mother.

"CTSN-SMR","Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) Evaluation of Outcomes Following Mitral Valve Repair/Replacement in Severe Chronic Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation (SMR)","Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a condition where the mitral valve, the valve that separates the left atrium from the left ventricle, allows blood to flow back into the left atrium during the systole or contraction phase of the heart. Significant backflow is usually symptomatic and can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary veins, resulting in pulmonary congestion; a condition of fluid build-up in the lungs. Primary MR occurs because of an abnormal mitral valve whereas secondary MR results from an abnormality of the left ventricle. Ischemic mitral valve regurgitation, a type of secondary MR, is usually attributed to a history of myocardial infarction where the area of the heart muscle that supports the mitral valve, has been damaged. Outcomes for those with ischemic mitral regurgitation are usually poor as their risk of mortality doubles. In an attempt to reduce the elevated risk of mortality, surgeons often recommend mitral valve repair over replacement. This recommendation is based on current literature but often lacks a side-by-side comparison of interventions.","At 12 months, there was no significant difference in survivorship, quality of life, or left ventricular reverse remodeling for those who had either surgical intervention. There was also no significant difference between the two groups in regards to the frequency of adverse events or the number of hospitalizations.

"PROP","Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) Core Database Protocol","Acute and chronic respiratory morbidities are common in premature births, and can pose significant risk to the infant’s health, particularly during the first two years of life. One such condition is bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) where infants require oxygen therapy due to abnormal repair and impaired lung development after acute lung injury. BPD poses a high mortality risk even in infants that survive the initial hospitalization. Regardless of BPD diagnosis, preterm infants frequently return for medical care due to symptoms of post-prematurity respiratory disease (PRD), which includes intermittent or chronic wheezing, cough without cold, poor growth, apnea and cyanosis, and lower respiratory tract infections. Impaired lung function can persist into adulthood, contributing to chronic respiratory diseases including asthma and emphysema.

However, at the time of the PROP study, there were no objective measures to predict which preterm infants will have persistent respiratory problems after discharge from the hospital. Furthermore, improved survival rates of premature infants and the high prevalence of lasting respiratory morbidities highlight the need for more comprehensive strategies to address both short-term and long-term respiratory complications. Thus, the Prematurity and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) was formed to investigate multiple research hypotheses on the molecular mechanisms that contribute to respiratory disease risk of premature neonates over the first year of life. Specifically, PROP investigators hypothesized that in survivors of extreme prematurity to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), specific biologic, physiologic and clinical data obtained during the initial hospitalization will predict respiratory morbidity between discharge and 1 year corrected age.","n/a

A total of 835 infants were enrolled."
"STICH","Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH)","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of heart failure, which in turn is a major cause of death and disability globally. Evidence from previous clinical trials supports the use of coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) to relieve disabling symptoms of angina, particularly among high-risk subgroups with extensive CAD. However, the studies did not include patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction, and developments in medical therapy have since led to updated guidelines. In addition, the benefits of CABG in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy had still not been clearly established at the time of this study. STICH sought to evaluate the role of CABG in the treatment of patients with CAD and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Reduced left ventricular function may occur after myocardial infarction, often in conjunction with left ventricular remodeling, including left ventricular enlargement and changes in chamber geometry. Left ventricular remodeling is correlated with progression of heart failure and a poor prognosis. Therefore, a surgical approach to remodeling through left ventricular volume reduction could improve outcomes for patients with CAD and heart failure. Surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) has been shown to reduce the left ventricular volume, increase the ejection fraction, and improve ventricular function. There is also evidence that SVR performed with CABG may reduce the rate of hospitalization and improve ventricular function, as compared to CABG alone. As part of a second hypothesis, STICH additionally investigated whether SVR when added to CABG would improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and CAD.","There was no significant difference between medical therapy alone and medical therapy plus CABG for death from any cause, though patients that underwent CABG had lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes, death from any cause, or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes. Adding SVR to CABG reduced the left ventricular volume, as compared with CABG alone. However, this anatomical change was not associated with a greater improvement in symptoms or exercise tolerance, or with a reduction in the rate of death or hospitalization for cardiac causes.

"IDEA","Innovative Approaches for Diet, Exercise, and Activity (IDEA)","A significant portion of the United States population, including young adults, is overweight or obese. Being overweight can lead to a number of related health complications and therefore it is a significant public health concern. Behavioral interventions that emphasize diet and physical activity are effective for short term weight loss, however sustained weight loss is more difficult to achieve. Technologies such as wearable devices have become widely available and marketed as means to improve lifestyle by tracking physical activity and other health metrics. Research has demonstrated that such technologies, when paired with a behavioral intervention, can lead to modest weight loss in the short-term. However, additional research is needed regarding use of technologies for long-term behavior change. In addition, many weight loss studies have focused on middle-age or older adults so additional research is needed for younger cohorts. Therefore the Innovative Approaches to Diet, Exercise and Activity (IDEA) study sought to evaluate the benefit of technological interventions in sustained weight lost for young adults.","Although both groups had significant improvements in body composition, fitness, physical activity, and diet, the addition of a wearable technology device to a standard behavioral intervention resulted in less weight loss over 24 months.

"TOLSURF","Trial of Late Surfactant for Prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: A Study in Ventilated Preterm Infants Receiving Inhaled Nitric Oxide (TOLSURF)","Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common form of chronic lung disease in children with an estimated 15,000 new cases annually in the United States. BPD affects infants born prematurely, is a major contributor to the cost of prematurity each year, and is associated with long-term pulmonary disability, neurodevelopmental abnormalities and death.

Increases in the survival of extremely low gestational age infants (ELGANs, ≤28 week gestation) have resulted in another form of BPD, which is characterized by impaired alveolar and microvascular development with excess tone and reactivity of airway smooth muscle.

Despite treatments to enhance lung maturation, premature infants often need prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation and/or oxygen support. When mechanical ventilation is required longer than 7 days, BPD results in 70% of surviving ELGANs. Most of these infants experience clinical episodes of increased requirement for ventilatory support that are associated with dysfunctional surfactant, which is primarily due to low surfactant protein B (SP-B). In pilot studies of late surfactant treatment in premature infants there was short-term improvement in SP-B content. These prior studies provided the rationale for a larger clinical trial for later doses of surfactant treatment to prevent episodes of respiratory decompensation and BPD.","There were no significant differences observed between the treatment group and the control group for survival without BPD at 36 weeks or 40 weeks.

Furthermore, the postpartum period poses unique challenges to weight loss, such as limited time or financial resources, or postpartum depression.

Previous trials have suggested that the incidence of excessive gestational weight gain or postpartum weight retention may be reduced through interventions such as education regarding physical activity and diet and/or weight tracking. The majority of women, including those of low income, have access to the internet, which may serve as an effective method to implement such behavioral interventions.

"CTSN/CCTRN-LVAD","Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) and Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) Left Ventricular Assist Device Therapy: Exploring the Effect of Intramyocardial Injection of Mesenchymal Precursor Cells on Myocardial Function (LVAD)","Heart failure is a condition where the heart muscle can no longer meet the oxygen demands of the body. In an attempt to preserve cardiac output, gradual cardiac remodeling occurs in the form of changes to the size, shape, and function of the heart. Eventually these changes weaken the heart and lead to a deterioration of left ventricular contractility. People diagnosed with advanced heart failure typically require a heart transplant or surgically implanted left ventricular assist device (LVAD). An LVAD is a pump that redirects blood from the left ventricle and moves it to the aorta. For people with a possibility of heart failure reversal, the LVAD can be removed if they show signs of recovery such as an improved ejection fraction and reverse remodeling. Because reverse remodeling is often not sufficient to remove the device, preliminary findings indicate that the administration of stem cells or allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) during implantation of the LVAD, may contribute to ventricular recovery. Injections of MPCs are correlated with increased numbers of cardiomyocytes and myocardial blood vessels, but their use during LVAD implantation needed closer examination.","The study demonstrated that administering MPCs during the implantation of an LVAD was safe as no patients had an adverse primary event within 90 days after randomization or during the 12-month follow-up. For efficacy, 50% of participants in the MPC group tolerated weaning at 90 days as compared to 20% of participants in the control group. These promising results indicate that further research would help establish if higher or additional doses of MPCs would help more participants have better outcomes. Further research is also indicated as this was a small study and successful weaning was influenced by participant comorbidities.

In such cases, it may be recommended that the patient receive a stem cell transplant, commonly using donated bone marrow. A first degree relative is likely to be the best candidate for donation if the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers are a sufficient match. For patients lacking a HLA-matched related donor, it is routine to initiate an unrelated donor search.  However some patients, particularly ethnic minorities, experience disease progression while awaiting identification of a suitably HLA-matched donor. Recently, stem cell transplants using umbilical cord blood have become a viable alternative option to treat these types of cancers.

Typically patients undergoing a stem cell transplant receive high doses of chemotherapy before the transplant to prepare their bodies to accept the donor stem cells. In this study, participants received a type of stem cell transplant called a non-myeloablative transplant, which is a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) method of transplantation that does not require high doses of chemotherapy. RIC can be preferable in patients that are older and less clinically fit, and therefore less able to withstand the chemotherapeutic agents’ toxicity levels.

"CTSN-POAF","Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) Rate Control Versus Rhythm Control For Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation (POAF)","Postoperative atrial fibrillation is the most common complication after cardiac surgery with an incidence of 20 to 50%. Consequences of postoperative atrial fibrillation include increases in rates of death, hospitalizations, and costs. There are currently two approaches to managing postoperative atrial fibrillation: heart-rate control (“rate control”) and rhythm control. The rhythm control method results in a more rapid conversion to sinus rhythm as compared to rate control, which may reduce thromboembolic risk, minimize exposure to anticoagulation, and result in faster restoration of functional capacity. However, rhythm control can also result in adverse effects due to the use of antiarrhythmic drugs or complications associated with cardioversion, which would be avoided by use of the rate control method. There is a lack of conclusive data and consensus regarding best practices for the management of postoperative atrial fibrillation, which has led to variations in practice. The CTSN-POAF trial was conducted to improve patient outcomes by determining the risks and benefits of rate control versus rhythm control.","Rhythm control and rate control treatment arms were associated with equal number of days of hospitalizations and similar complication rates. Overall, neither method showed a significant clinical advantage over the other.

Approximately 15,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the U.S. with initial symptoms presenting as painless swelling in lymph nodes of the neck, armpit, or groin. Radiation is often the initial and only treatment needed if few nodes are affected in the same region. When diffuse nodes are affected, chemotherapy is recommended but relapse is common. For advanced FL, another treatment option is to receive a blood stem cell transplant in a procedure called allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). To prepare for the transplant, individuals receive high doses of chemotherapy in order to destroy cancerous cells and reduce the likelihood of transplant rejection. High doses of chemotherapy though are associated with several risks, some of which are life threatening. In this study, participants received lower doses of chemotherapy in an effort to reduce the severity of side effects and rate of mortality.","The primary endpoint was 74%. This and other findings demonstrate that alloHCT with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, RTX (FCR) provides excellent PFS for high risk FL patients.

"CHOICES","Choosing Healthy Options in College Environments and Settings (CHOICES)","Obesity is a major public health priority. Approximately 5.5 million Americans are obese by the age of 30. Recent research shows that once individuals gain weight, losing weight and maintaining that weight loss is difficult. The young adult years, ages 18-35, are an influential period for excess weight gain and unhealthy weight-related behaviors. At-risk young adult populations are at a particularly high risk for a range of adverse weight-related outcomes. A study found that students enrolled in 2-year colleges, particularly women, had a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity, lower levels of physical activity, more TV viewing, and higher intakes of soda and fast food compared with students attending 4-year colleges. The use of technology to successfully engage participants in weight-related interventions has been identified as a priority area for future research with the young adult age group. The Choosing Healthy Options in College Environments and Settings (CHOICES) study was one of seven trials funded through the EARLY consortium, and tested the effectiveness of a 24-month intervention to reduce unhealthy weight gain in 2-year community college students.","There was not a statistically significant difference in BMI between conditions at the end of the trial. However, participants randomized to the intervention who were overweight or obese at baseline were more than three times as likely to transition to a healthy weight by the end of the trial as compared with control students.

"BMT CTN-0902","Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) A Phase III Randomized, Multicenter Trial Testing Whether Exercise or Stress Management Improves Functional Status and Symptoms of Autologous and Allogeneic Recipients (0902)","HCT is associated with numerous adverse symptoms, such as nausea, fatigue, and sleep disturbance, which are a detriment to patient short and long-term quality of life as a result of decreased physical and mental health. Although most longitudinal studies show return to baseline functioning for the majority of patients, it may take years to reach this goal. Clinical trials have shown that training in stress management techniques and participation in formal exercise programs each offered in isolation are effective in improving quality of life in patients receiving standard-dose chemotherapy and HCT. Review of these studies suggests that stress management interventions primarily improve mental health outcomes and nausea. The impact of exercise training interventions is more variable; most studies report physical health benefits, with some studies also reporting mental health benefits. Small studies suggest that combining stress management training and exercise are feasible and well-tolerated, but whether the combination provides an additive or synergistic impact on quality of life outcomes had not been directly investigated prior to this study.","There were no differences in the primary endpoints of the physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component scales of the SF36 at day 100 among the groups based on an intention-to-treat analysis. There were no differences observed in overall survival, hospital days through day 100 post-HCT, or in other patient-reported outcomes, including treatment-related distress, sleep quality, pain, and nausea. Patients randomized to training in stress management reported more use of those techniques; patients randomized to exercise training did not report more physical activity. Although other studies have reported efficacy of more intensive interventions, brief training in an easy-to-disseminate format for either self-directed exercise or stress management was not effective in this trial.

Meta-analyses of BMC delivery to the infarct zone following AMI have shown small improvements in LV function after successful reperfusion. Myocardium and bone marrow undergo important changes days to weeks following AMI that may affect stem/progenitor cell engraftment and survival. To determine the optimal time to administer BMCs, the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) developed two prospective clinical trials, TIME and LateTIME. The LateTIME trial found BMC administration did not influence the ongoing post-reperfusion recovery of either global or regional LV function when delivered 2-3 weeks following AMI. TIME was performed as a companion trial to investigate influences of timing of cell delivery within the first week following AMI on the course of improving global and regional LV function following reperfusion.","Patients with STEMI, who underwent successful primary PCI and administration of intra-coronary BMCs at either 3 or 7 days following the event, had recovery of global and regional LV function similar to placebo.

"CCTRN-LateTIME","Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) A Phase II, Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind Pilot Trial Evaluating the Safety and Effect of Administration of Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells Two to Three Weeks Following Acute Myocardial Infarction (LateTIME)","Several randomized trials have demonstrated that administration of autologous BMCs following acute MI may result in improvement in left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or regional LV function and may be associated with decreased clinical adverse events. However, the majority of trials have administered BMCs within the first week following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). To determine the optimal time to administer BMCs, the NHLBI-sponsored Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) developed two prospective clinical trials, TIME and LateTIME. TIME was designed to compare the effects of BMC delivery in patients with predominantly ST segment MIs at 3 versus 7 days post-MI, while LateTIME was designed to explore whether delayed BMC delivery 2-3 weeks following MI could improve global and regional LV function. The time frame of 2-3 weeks post-MI may be particularly important for those patients who present to centers that lack expertise in cell therapy or those patients initially too sick as a result of cardiogenic shock or other medical issues. These patients may particularly benefit from cell therapy given that several trials have demonstrated that those patients with the most depressed LV function appear to derive the most improvement from BMC delivery.","Among patients with MI and LV dysfunction following reperfusion with PCI, intracoronary infusion of autologous BMCs compared to intracoronary placebo infusion, 2-3 weeks after PCI did not improve global or regional function at 6 months.

"SPRINT","Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)","Hypertension is a highly prevalent condition among adults and is a leading risk factor for myocardial infarction and stroke. Further, isolated systolic hypertension is the most common form of hypertension in adults over 50 years of age. Observational studies have shown a monotonic increase in cardiovascular risk with systolic blood pressures above 115 mm Hg; however, general population clinical trials have only documented the benefits of lowering systolic blood pressure to a target of 150 mm Hg. A 2007 expert panel sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute designated the hypothesis that lowering the systolic blood pressure goal to a level <120 mm Hg as the most important hypothesis to test in reducing hypertension related complications in those without diabetes.","The blood pressure intervention was stopped in August of 2015 (median follow-up of 3.26 years) after the cardiovascular outcome results exceeded the boundary for efficacy at two consecutive time points. Compared with a systolic blood pressure target of less than 140 mm Hg, an intensive systolic blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause. Significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

"BMT CTN-0301","Blood and Marrow Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) Fludarabine-based Conditioning for Severe Aplastic Anemia (0301)","Unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is an option for the treatment of patients with severe acquired aplastic anemia who do not have HLA-matched siblings and sustained responses to immunosuppressive therapy. Outcomes after unrelated donor BMT have improved over the past decades, presumably because of closer donor–recipient HLA matching and improved supportive care.

The optimum preparative regimen remains to be established. Ideally, the conditioning regimen should maximize engraftment while minimizing organ toxicity. However, with transplant conditioning at the time of the study, graft rejection and regimen-related toxicity continued to adversely affect patient outcome. Conditioning regimens for unrelated donor BMT in patients with aplastic anemia are typically combinations of cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte globulin, and total body irradiation (TBI). Although cyclophosphamide is a key part of the preparative regimen for patients with severe aplastic anemia, the optimum dose remained undefined. In view of the known toxicities linked to high-dose (i.e., 200 mg/kg) cyclophosphamide, a reduction of the cyclophosphamide dose would be desirable.

The study investigated whether the combination of fludarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin, and TBI would enable reduction of the cyclophosphamide dose to less than 200 mg/kg while maintaining engraftment and having a survival similar to or better than that with standard regimens using a cyclophosphamide dose of 200 mg/kg (known to be associated with significant organ toxicity) for unrelated donor transplantation for severe aplastic anemia.","The study identified cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg as the most desirable dose in combination with TBI 2 Gy, fludarabine 120 mg/m², and anti-thymocyte globulin for engraftment and early survival for unrelated donor transplantation in patients with severe acquired aplastic anemia. A dose of 100 mg/kg, although slightly less desirable, also provided promising early results. These cyclophosphamide doses should be assessed further, ideally in the context of a randomized trial.

Additionally, the study examined the degree of cyclophosphamide (CY) dose reduction achievable with the introduction of fludarabine in the preparative regimen, with the goal of maintaining (or improving) engraftment, reducing major transplant-related toxicity and early deaths, and thereby ultimately improving long-term survival.","Between Feb 22, 2006, and Aug 1, 2007, 21 patients were accrued to phase 1 of the study.

"THAPCA-IH","Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (In-Hospital) (THAPCA-IH)","Current guidelines recommend either hypothermia or normothermia for temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults and children. Published results of clinical trials of therapeutic hypothermia versus therapeutic normothermia in adults and children who have had an in-hospital cardiac arrest are lacking. Patients who have experienced an in-hospital cardiac arrest represent a pathophysiologically distinct population from those who have experienced an out-of-hospital arrest, and the potential efficacy of an intervention may differ in the two populations. The THAPCA-IH trial was initiated due to the lack of published results from randomized trials on pediatric populations, and the significant differences that exist regarding cardiac arrest in pediatric and adult populations.","The trial was terminated due to futility after 329 patients were randomized. Among the patients who had a VABS-II score of ≥70 before cardiac arrest, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the hypothermia group and the normothermia group. Among all randomized patients, the change in the VABS-II score from baseline to 12 months was not significantly different and 1-year survival was similar between the groups.

"WHI-CTOS","Women's Health Initiative: Clinical Trial and Observational Study (WHI-CTOS)","The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing the major causes of death, disability, and frailty in postmenopausal women, specifically heart disease, cancer, and osteoporotic fractures. The WHI is primarily composed of an observational study (OS), as well a clinical trial (CT) with three components: Hormone Replacement Therapy (HT), Dietary Modification, (DM) and Calcium/Vitamin D supplementation (CaD).

Prior to the WHI, observational studies suggested that postmenopausal hormone therapy was associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Potential cardioprotection was based on generally supportive data on lipid levels in intermediate outcome clinical trials, trials in nonhuman primates, and a large body of observational studies suggesting a 40% to 50% reduction in risk among users of either estrogen alone or, less frequently, combined estrogen and progestin. Observational studies primarily examining unopposed estrogen preparations have suggested a 30% to 50% reduction in coronary events, and an 8% to 30% increase in breast cancer with extended use. Other research findings indicated that hormone therapy was also associated with a decreased risk of osteoporosis and increased bone density. The WHI HT trials were designed to test the effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on risk for coronary heart disease and assess overall risks and benefits in predominantly healthy women.

The Women’s Health Initiative Memory Program (WHIMS) consists of a suite of studies which include cohorts of women who participated in the WHI HT trials. Postmenopausal women have a greater risk than men of developing Alzheimer’s disease, but studies of the effects of estrogen therapy on Alzheimer’s disease have been inconsistent. Additionally, observational studies have suggested that postmenopausal hormone treatment may improve cognitive function, but data from randomized clinical trials have been sparse and inconclusive.

International comparisons and migration studies have suggested that countries with 50% lower fat intake than the US population had approximately one third the risk of colorectal cancer. Additionally, fairly consistent evidence existed for an effect of dietary fat, vegetables and fruits, and grains on colorectal cancer risk from within-country observational studies, although the protective effect of lower fat intake was no longer clear after adjusting for energy intake. The WHI DM trial was the first randomized trial to directly address the health effects of a low-fat eating pattern in predominantly healthy postmenopausal women from diverse racial/ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Osteoporosis is a major cause of injury, loss of independence, and death, and contributes to hip fractures. Observational evidence and data from previous randomized clinical trials suggest that calcium and/or vitamin D supplements may slow bone loss and reduce the risk of falls in postmenopausal and elderly women. However, evidence from trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with respect to hip and other fractures was limited at the time the WHI was initiated. In two prior randomized trials, calcium plus vitamin D supplements did not reduce the risk of nonvertebral fractures among older women. When the WHI CaD trial was designed, guidelines recommended daily intakes of 800 to 1200 mg of calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D for the prevention of osteoporosis, which was not met by many American women. Therefore, the WHI CaD trial was designed to test the primary hypothesis that postmenopausal women randomly assigned to calcium plus vitamin D supplementation would have a lower risk of hip fracture and, secondarily, of all fractures than women assigned to placebo.","Overall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin after an average 5.2 year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women (JAMA 2002;288:321-333). Among postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older, estrogen plus progestin did not improve cognitive function when compared with placebo (JAMA. 2003 May 28;289(20):2663-72), increased the risk for probable dementia, and did not prevent mild cognitive impairment (JAMA. 2003 May 28;289(20):2651-62). The use of conjugated equine estrogen increased the risk of stroke, decreased the risk of hip fracture, and did not affect CHD incidence in postmenopausal women with prior hysterectomy after an average of 6.8 years of follow-up (JAMA. 2004 April 14; 291(14):1701-1712). Over approximately 8 years of follow-up, a low-fat dietary pattern did not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (JAMA 2006;295:643-654). Calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density; however, no significant difference was observed in hip fractures (N Engl J Med 2006;354:669-683).","Heart Diseases, Myocardial Ischemia, Osteoporosis, Postmenopause, Bone Diseases, Breast Neoplasms, Cardiovascular Diseases, Colonic Neoplasms, Coronary Disease","The clinical trial assessed the safety and efficacy of three interventions. Specifically, it evaluated (1) the major health benefits and risks of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone, (2) the effects of a low-fat eating pattern on risk of colorectal cancer, and (3) the efficacy of calcium with vitamin D supplementation for preventing hip and other fractures. The objective of the memory study was to determine whether estrogen plus progestin therapy protects global cognitive function, and evaluate the therapy’s effect on the incidence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.

The observational study is examining the relationship between lifestyle, socioeconomic, health, and other risk factors with cardiovascular, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and osteoporotic fracture outcomes. Secondary objectives include providing more reliable estimates of the extent to which known risk factors predict disease, more precise estimates of new occurrences of disease, and to provide a future resource for the identification of new or novel risk factors especially factors found in blood.","Postmenopausal women ages 50 to 79 were eligible to participate. A woman was considered postmenopausal if she had experienced no vaginal bleeding for 6 months (12 months for women under 55 years of age), had had a hysterectomy, or had ever used postmenopausal hormones.  Recruitment was carried out in 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. The clinical trial components had additional specific inclusion or exclusion criteria.

A total of 68,132 women were randomized into at least one component of the clinical trial. 27,347 women were enrolled in the hormone therapy component with 16,608 in the estrogen plus progestin trial and 10,739 in the unopposed estrogen trial, 48,835 women were enrolled in the diet modification component, and 36,282 women were enrolled in the calcium/vitamin D component. 7,479 women 65 years of age and older at baseline and that participated in the HT trial component were enrolled in the ancillary memory study.

Women who were either ineligible or unwilling to participate in the clinical trial component were enrolled in the observational study. For example, many potential participants to the clinical trial component of the study were already undertaking a low fat diet or were using hormone replacement therapy. The effect of the selection process was that women enrolled in the observational study tended to have healthier lifestyles compared to those enrolled in the clinical trial. In total, 93,676 subjects were enrolled in WHI OS, with over 16% being members of a racial/ethnic minority group.

The first WHI Extension Study enrolled 115,407 consenting participants from all components of the original WHI study for an additional five years of follow-up, from 2005 to 2010. In 2010, 93,567 women consented to continued follow-up."

An alternative treatment being developed is therapeutic angiogenesis, which involves stimulating the growth of new blood vessels. Recent research has shown that withdrawing stem cells from bone marrow and implanting the cells into heart tissue may be an effective way to achieve therapeutic angiogenesis.

Initial studies- including a pilot study in Brazil and a phase I trial of autologous BMC therapy in heart failure (FOCUS-HF)-have shown that transendocardial delivery of BMCs appeared safe in patients with chronic heart failure due to multi-vessel coronary artery disease, but definitive assessments of efficacy were not evaluated due to insufficient enrollment numbers. The FOCUS-CCTRN was designed to investigate the efficacy of specific measures such as left ventricular (LV) function, perfusion, and functional capacity in autologous cell therapy of patient with ischemic heart disease.","There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the treatment and placebo groups. In patients with chronic ischemic heart disease, transendocardial injection of BMCs compared to placebo did not improve LVESV, MV02, or reversibility in SPECT.

"WRAP-IPF","Weighing Risks and Benefits of Laparoscopic Anti-Reflux Surgery in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (WRAP-IPF)","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease of unknown cause and increasing prevalence in the United States. Aside from lung transplantation, which approximately only 1% of patients will receive, there is no FDA-approved therapy. Abnormal acid gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) has been well described in patients with IPF and is thought to play a role in the progression of the disease. The several retrospective cohort studies that have assessed the association of anti-acid therapies for GER with clinical outcomes in IPF have had inconsistent results.","In patients with IPF and abnormal acid GER, laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is safe and well tolerated but did not significantly slow the rate of FVC decline. Further research is needed, particularly with a larger study in order to achieve sufficient statistical power, regarding the possible benefits of anti-reflux surgery in this population.

"CCTRN-PACE","Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) Clinical and MR Imaging Assessments in Patients With Intermittent Claudication Following Injection of Bone Marrow Derived ALDH Bright Cells (PACE)","Atherosclerotic PAD affects 8–12% of Americans over 65 and is associated with a major decline in functional status, increased myocardial infarction and stroke rates, and increased risk of ischemic amputation. Claudication represents the most prevalent limb ischemic symptom, affecting 1–3 million Americans. Current treatment strategies for claudication have limitations. For example, pharmacotherapy may not achieve an ideal response rate and supervised exercise efficacy may be limited by co-morbidities. Cell therapy represents a promising approach. However, to date, there has only been one prior randomized, controlled clinical trial that evaluated the potential of these cells to improve exercise performance in claudication. The vast majority of cell therapy trials in PAD have focused on critical limb ischemia. The Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN) noted the need for a clinical trial with both clinical and physiologically focused endpoints.","In patients with PAD, ALDHbr cell administration is safe but did not improve PWT, collateral count, peak hyperemic popliteal flow or capillary perfusion. Further research is needed, particularly with a larger study in order to achieve sufficient statistical power, regarding the possible increase in PWT after treatment with ALDHbr cells.

The pathophysiology of claudication is complex. The MRI techniques developed for this study may be utilized in future PAD clinical research to identify the ideal cell dose and timing of one or more cell administrations to determine if a clinically relevant therapeutic benefit might be achieved.

Currently, the only strategy that offers a cure is allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, many patients do not undergo HCT because of advanced age or unacceptable risks associated with HCT. One risk is TRM due to toxicity from pre-transplant MAC. In recent years, RIC regimens were introduced in an attempt to reduce TRM. Age is one of many factors considered to select for RIC versus MAC, thus complicating the interpretation of previous nonrandomized studies. Consequently, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) conduced a phase III randomized trial comparing RIC and MAC in patients with AML or MDS.","OS was higher with MAC, but this was not statistically significant. RIC resulted in lower TRM but higher relapse rates compared to MAC, with a statistically significant advantage in RFS with MAC. The accrual of patients was halted because of ethical concerns over higher than expected relapse rates in patients receiving RIC. These data support the use of MAC as the standard of care for fit patients with AML or MDS.

"REDS III-U.S. Zika (non-BioLINCC)","Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS III) US Natural History Cohort of Zika Virus RNA Positive Blood Donors (U.S. Zika)","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that can also be transmitted congenitally and through transfusion and sexual contact.  It was first identified in the Zika forest in Uganda in the 1950’s.  More recently, it spread to Malaysia and Indonesia, then to Micronesia, French Polynesia and, in 2014 to Brazil.  Although asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in most cases, ZIKV can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome and infection during pregnancy has been associated with intrauterine fetal death and congenital Zika syndrome.  The goal of this study was to characterize viral persistence and immune responses to Zika infection following acute infection.  This information is needed to inform blood donor and diagnostic testing policies and understand the natural history of ZIKV infection. The study was designed to enable development of a comprehensive repository of well-characterized samples to support 1) validation of screening and diagnostic ZIKV assays, 2) studies of host immune responses to ZIKV to inform vaccine development and novel therapeutic approaches, 3) analyses of mechanisms of clearance or persistence and 4) analyses of predictive markers of symptom development","Determinations of viral marker persistence are enhanced by follow-up of pre- and asymptomatic RNA+/Ab- blood donors. We found higher rates of post-donation symptomatic infection than in most previous reports. RBC-associated ZIKV RNA persists for several months following clearance from plasma and body fluids, and replicate highly sensitive NAT testing extends RNA detection in all compartments. WB testing can extend detection of acute infection for diagnostics and monitoring of pregnant women, sexual partners and travellers.","Zika, Blood Donors","This study (REDS-III US Zika Natural History Study) used donor NAT screening to identify and enroll asymptomatic ZIKV infected blood donors into a one-year follow-up study. The study design enabled identification of donors early in acute infection (i.e., before or shortly after development of ZIKV-specific immune responses), representing a highly informative population for characterization of laboratory parameters and incidence of clinical findings. We sought to investigate the dynamics of viral and serological markers and clinical symptomatology following acute ZIKV infection in NAT-positive blood donors, and collect comprehensive data on viral persistence in blood compartments and body fluids in DENV-exposed and -naïve donors to estimate time from infection to earliest detection of Zika; time to loss of detectable virus from plasma, red cells and other compartments; and time to emergence and loss of immune response to infection.","53 initially asymptomatic blood donors recruited into follow-up study were eligible for enrollment if donating at blood centers participating in our follow-up study (Banco de Sangre de Servicios Mutuos, OneBlood, Vitalant, New York Blood Center or American Red Cross) from April through December 2016, coinciding with a large ZIKV virus epidemic in PR and small autochthonous outbreak in South Florida. Blood donor index donation plasma samples were screened using either the RMS cobas® Zika or Grifols Procleix Zika Virus NAT assays. ZIKV infection in NAT-reactive donors was confirmed by repeat-reactivity on the screening NAT assay, reactivity on a confirmatory RT-PCR assay on index plasma, or ZIKV IgM seroconversion in index or follow-up serum samples; this supplemental testing was conducted as part of the manufacturers’ INDs.   ZIKV quantitative viral load (VL) testing (qRT-PCR) was performed on plasma and residual RBC when available, and serological testing for ZIKV (IgM and IgG) and DENV (IgG) were performed on index and follow-up serum at VRI. Eligible participants were consented for follow-up study through a protocol approved by the UCSF Committee for Human Research. Follow-up visits were requested at weeks 1, 3, 6 and months 3, 6, 9, 12 following index NAT-reactive donations."
"BMT CTN-0501","Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) Multi-center, Open Label, Randomized Trial Comparing Single Versus Double Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) Transplantation in Pediatric Patients With High Risk Leukemia and Myelodysplasia (0501)","Umbilical cord-blood has been used as the source of hematopoietic stem cells in an estimated 30,000 transplants. As compared with stem-cell grafts from adult donors, cord blood has the advantages of more rapid availability, relative absence of donor attrition, and, after transplantation, a reduced risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the limited number of hematopoietic cells in a single cord-blood unit prevents its use in recipients with larger body mass and results in delayed hematopoietic recovery and higher mortality. For this reason, various strategies have been explored to increase the number of hematopoietic stem cells in a cord-blood graft, including the infusion of two cord-blood units from different partially HLA-matched donors. A pilot study evaluating the safety and efficacy of double-unit cord-blood transplantation was performed, with promising results. As adequate single UCB units can be identified for > 80% of pediatric recipients (in contrast to < 30% for adults), this study was open only to pediatric patients. The population was restricted to patients with high-risk hematologic malignancy, the most common indication of UCB transplantation in children.","These results indicate that double-unit cord-blood transplantation does not confer a survival advantage in children and adolescents. Poorer platelet recovery and higher rates of grade III and IV acute and extensive chronic GVHD were observed after double-unit transplantation. The risk of relapse was similar in the two treatment groups.

Emergency medical services (EMS) paramedics commonly perform ETI or insertion of supraglottic airways (SGAs), such as the LT, on patients with OHCA to facilitate oxygenation and protect the lungs from aspiration of vomitus. Because SGA insertion is rapid, simple, and requires less training compared to ETI, many EMS agencies have incorporated this as the primary method of ventilation during OHCA resuscitation. However, the optimal method for OHCA advanced airway management is unknown.","Among adults with OHCA, a strategy of initial LT insertion was associated with significantly greater 72-hour survival compared with a strategy of initial ETI. These findings suggest that LT insertion may be considered as an initial airway management strategy in patients with OHCA, but limitations of the pragmatic design, practice setting, and ETI performance characteristics suggest that further research is warranted.

Furthermore, prehospital transfusion (PHT) studies from military and civilian hospitals have shown that prehospital transfusion of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) is not only feasible, but associated with improved coagulation status on arrival.  Prehospital resuscitation practices in the US differ significantly in approach, with most systems using crystalloids while a few offer RBCs or a combination of plasma and RBCs.

"AsthmaNet-BARD","AsthmaNet Best African American Response to Asthma Drugs (BARD)","Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that African American patients with asthma experience more complications including exacerbations, asthma-related urgent-care visits, hospitalizations, and deaths, as compared to Caucasian patients with asthma. Ethnicity can also influence medication response, and studies have shown that African Americans patients have more glucocorticoid resistance, less cellular sensitivity to glucocorticoids, and more eosinophilic inflammation during inhaled glucocorticoid treatment than Caucasian patients. This may be due to the effect of genetic variants on response to pharmacotherapy for asthma.

Asthma symptoms are primarily controlled with inhaled glucocorticoids, but a longacting β2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) may be used as an additional treatment when glucocorticoids alone do not sufficiently suppress symptoms. However, prior to the BARD study, this recommendation was based on studies with limited numbers of African American patients and without evaluation of differences in genetic ancestry. In particular, additional analysis has indicated that adding a LABA was not superior to increasing the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid in African American patients. Therefore, the BARD trials were initiated to address this gap in scientific understanding and determine a preferred pharmacotherapy strategy in African American children, adolescents, and adults.","In African American adolescents and adults with poorly controlled asthma, the addition of a LABA to inhaled glucocorticoid was more likely to produce superior responses than increasing the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid. In contrast, almost half of the African American children with poorly controlled asthma had a superior response to an increase in the dose of an inhaled glucocorticoid and almost half had a superior response to the addition of a LABA.

Exacerbations are costly and are associated with considerable complications. In addition, asthma exacerbations may lead to progressive loss of lung function and greater asthma severity over time. Day-to-day asthma symptoms are traditionally controlled through conventional therapies, particularly the daily use of inhaled glucocorticoids; however, they have only partial efficacy in preventing exacerbations.

There is limited evidence available to inform clinicians’ selection and implementation of strategies in the “yellow zone” (i.e., when there are signs of early loss of asthma control) to prevent these early symptoms from progressing to a full asthma exacerbation. Quadrupling the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids was identified as a potentially efficacious intervention in adult patients, but data on the safety or efficacy of an intervention that uses more than a doubled dose of inhaled glucocorticoids are limited in children. The objective of this study was to determine whether quintupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids at the onset of “yellow zone” symptoms reduces the rate of severe asthma exacerbations treated with oral corticosteroids.","In children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma treated with daily inhaled glucocorticoids, quintupling the dose at the early signs of loss of asthma control did not reduce the rate of severe asthma exacerbations or improve other asthma outcomes  and may be associated with diminished linear growth.

"AsthmaNet-APRIL/OCELOT","AsthmaNet Azithromycin for Preventing the Development of Upper Respiratory Tract Illness Into Lower Respiratory Tract Symptoms in Children (APRIL) and Oral Corticosteroids for Treating Episodes of Significant Lower Respiratory Tract Symptoms in Children (OCELOT)","Children up to six years of age may commonly experience acute episodes of severe lower respiratory tract illness, which are often associated with substantial morbidity that result in urgent or emergency care. Children experiencing episodes of severe wheezing are often treated with oral corticosteroids (OCSs) based on their efficacy in the management of asthma in older children.

At the time of the studies, the etiology of these acute episodes was not well understood. Investigations have shown presence of both respiratory viruses as well as bacteria in nasopharyngeal secretions of such patients. Identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Moraxella catarrhalis in nasal samples also containing rhinovirus was associated with increased likelihood of having an asthma exacerbation in children 4 to 12 years of age. Telithromycin is a ketolide antibiotic that has been found to significantly improve symptom scores and lung function when administered within the first 24 hours of acute asthma episodes, suggesting a mechanism unrelated to direct antimicrobial action. Based on these and other findings, the APRIL study was initiated to investigate the early administration of the macrolide azithromycin in preschool children with recurrent severe LRTIs to determine if this intervention can safely prevent the progression of such episodes. In addition, the benefit of OCS use in severe episodes remained unclear, with the possibility for adverse reactions. Therefore the OCELOT trial was also initiated to evaluate OCS treatment in cases where the episode does progress.","Among young children with histories of recurrent severe LRTIs, the APRIL trial found that the use of azithromycin early during an apparent RTI compared with placebo reduced the likelihood of severe LRTI. More information is needed on the development of antibiotic-resistant pathogens with this strategy.

"ICARE","Improved Cardiovascular Risk Reduction to Enhance Rural Primary Care (ICARE)","More than 2200 Americans die of cardiovascular disease every day. Team-based care and medication therapy management have become useful strategies to reduce gaps in delivery of guideline-concordant therapy for cardiovascular therapy. Physician offices, especially in rural and smaller communities, lack the resources to implement team-based care with pharmacists who can provide medication therapy management. The ICARE trial developed a physician-pharmacist collaborative model to provide virtual clinical pharmacy services from a central location to 12 family medicine offices in Iowa to evaluate whether a centralized, remote, clinical pharmacy service could improve outcomes.","There was no improvement in the GA score from baseline to 12 months in the control group. There was a statistically significant improvement in the intervention group in GA score plus several criteria were significantly better for intervention subjects including appropriate statin therapy, body mass index (BMI) screening and alcohol screening. Only 13.7% of subjects with diabetes had hemoglobin A1C at goal at baseline and this increased to 30.8% and 21.0% in the intervention and control group, respectively, at 12 months.

The improvements in outcomes were modest, and not statistically significant, due to higher than anticipated baseline guideline adherence and more inter-office variability than anticipated.

"AsthmaNet-INFANT/AVICA","AsthmaNet Individualized Therapy For Asthma in Toddlers (INFANT) and Acetaminophen Versus Ibuprofen in Children With Asthma (AVICA)","Although asthma treatment guidelines have proved useful in care standardization and reduction of adverse outcomes, there is phenotypic heterogeneity within the disorder and a growing appreciation for personalized medicine. Young children are particularly diverse, yet, at the time of this trial, they were incompletely studied. Among young children who warrant treatment with daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the response to ICS is inconsistent. This raises the question of whether daily therapy with ICS is warranted in all children. Therefore, INFANT characterized phenotypic heterogeneity in young children with mild persistent asthma and determined whether individual children responded better to daily ICS, daily leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), or as-needed ICS co-administered with a short-acting bronchodilator.
 
Observational data from pediatric cohorts have suggested an association between acetaminophen use and asthma-related complications. However, at the time of the AVICA study appropriately designed randomized trials that prospectively evaluated the association between acetaminophen use by children and asthma symptoms were lacking. Given that both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the only readily available agents for fever or pain in young children, the AVICA study sought to investigate whether the use of acetaminophen, compared to the use of ibuprofen, was associated with higher morbidity related to asthma among young children with mild persistent asthma.","The INFANT study found clinically relevant improvements in response to one treatment versus others in the majority of young children with mild persistent asthma symptoms and recurrent wheezing episodes.

"AsthmaNet-ALFA","AsthmaNet Proof of Concept Study of Alendronate for Asthma (ALFA)","Long-acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (LABAs) can be used to supplement inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in asthma patients with inadequately controlled symptoms. However a significant portion of patients still do not obtain adequate control using this treatment strategy. This may be due to the loss of bronchoprotection (LOBP) that can occur with regular LABA use, meaning the treatment has diminished capacity to protect against airway narrowing in response to bronchoconstrictors. At the time of the ALFA study, the mechanism causing LOBP was unknown, but thought to be related to β2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR) downregulation through internalization, B2AR phosphorylation by G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases, and/or uncoupling from the adenylyl cyclase-mediated signaling pathway, among other mechanisms. Previous in vitro research has found that alendronate prevents both BA-induced internalization and loss of functional activation, and may preserve bronchoprotection against acetylcholine after long-term BA exposure. Therefore, the ALFA study hypothesized that alendronate would reduce LOBP occurrence in asthma patients treated with ICSs and regularly administered LABAs. The study also aimed to identify the mechanism responsible for LOBP, explore the role of exhaled nitric oxide in predicting LOBP, and investigate salivary α-amylase as a potential biomarker for B2AR dynamics.","This study did not find evidence that alendronate reduces LABA-associated LOBP. LOBP appears to be less common than presumed in concomitant ICS plus LABA-treated asthmatic patients.

"AsthmaNet-Microbiome","AsthmaNet Airway Microbiome in Asthma: Relationships to Asthma Phenotype and Inhaled Corticosteroid Treatment","Recent studies have shown that the composition of lower respiratory tract bacteria (microbiota) differs between healthy adults and adults with asthma. Additionally, phenotypic features of asthma, such as measures of airway hyper-responsiveness, asthma control, and transcriptional response to steroids, correlate with patterns of bronchial microbiota composition. In most of the previous studies, subjects with asthma were treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), casting some uncertainty on whether the findings reflect the effects of ICS treatment or of asthma itself. Similarly, many patients with asthma are atopic, raising the question as to whether asthma-associated differences in respiratory microbiota are related to underlying atopy. The MICROBIOME study sought to elucidate differences in bronchial microbiota associated with asthma versus atopy, and with important phenotypic features of this disease, such as responsiveness to ICS treatment.","The bronchial bacterial microbiota of both atopic asthmatics and atopic non-asthmatics differ from that of healthy controls and also differ from each other. There were no significant changes in bacterial burden or diversity between measurements at baseline and after six weeks of treatment with ICS in adults with asthma.

"REDS III-U.S. Zika","Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS III) U.S. Natural History Cohort of Zika Virus RNA Positive Blood Donors (U.S. Zika)","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus that can also be transmitted congenitally and through transfusion and sexual contact. It was first identified in the Zika forest in Uganda in the 1950’s. More recently, it spread to Malaysia and Indonesia, then to Micronesia, French Polynesia and, in 2014 to Brazil. Although asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in most cases, ZIKV can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome and infection during pregnancy has been associated with intrauterine fetal death and congenital Zika syndrome. The goal of this study was to characterize viral persistence and immune responses to Zika infection following acute infection. This information is needed to inform blood donor and diagnostic testing policies and understand the natural history of ZIKV infection.","Determinations of viral marker persistence are enhanced by follow-up of pre- and asymptomatic RNA+/Ab- blood donors. The study found higher rates of post-donation symptomatic infection than in most previous reports. RBC-associated ZIKV RNA persists for several months following clearance from plasma and body fluids, and replicate highly sensitive NAT testing extends RNA detection in all compartments. WB testing can extend detection of acute infection for diagnostics and monitoring of pregnant women, sexual partners and travelers.","Zika, Blood Donors","This REDS-III US Zika Natural History Study sought to investigate the dynamics of viral and serological markers and clinical symptomatology following acute Zika virus infection in nucleic acid test (NAT) -positive blood donors, and collect comprehensive data on viral persistence in blood compartments and body fluids in dengue virus (DENV)-exposed and -naïve donors to estimate time from infection to earliest detection of Zika; time to loss of detectable virus from plasma, red cells and other compartments; and time to emergence and loss of immune response to infection.","Fifty-three ZIKV-infected blood donors were enrolled in the study. Participants were identified from asymptomatic donors at participating blood centers (Banco de Sangre de Servicios Mutuos, OneBlood, Vitalant, New York Blood Center or American Red Cross) from April through December 2016, coinciding with a large ZIKV virus epidemic in Puerto Rico and small autochthonous outbreak in South Florida. Blood donor index donation plasma samples were screened using either the RMS cobas® Zika or Grifols Procleix Zika Virus NAT assays. ZIKV infection in NAT-reactive donors was confirmed by repeat-reactivity on the screening NAT assay, reactivity on a confirmatory RT-PCR assay on index plasma, or ZIKV IgM seroconversion in index or follow-up serum samples."
"iCOMPARE","Individualized Comparative Effectiveness of Models Optimizing Patient Safety and Resident Education (iCOMPARE)","For decades, there has been debate about the effects of the long duty hours of resident physicians.

Further restrictions that limited shifts to 16 hours for first-year residents (interns) were implemented in 2011.

After the 2011 ACGME policies were implemented, program directors reported a reduced quality of training and professional maturation, increased frequency of handoffs of care, and decreased continuity, without improved patient safety or quality of care.

The iCOMPARE trial compared internal-medicine residency programs with either standard duty hours, as adopted by the ACGME in 2011, or flexible duty hours to address questions concerning the safety of patients who are cared for by the trainees (both interns and residents), the education that trainees receive, and the trainees’ sleep patterns and well-being.","<b>Patient Safety:</b>

As a result, low–tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is now recommended for all patients with ARDS, although penetration of this evidence-based practice has been limited, especially early in mechanical ventilation. LTVV may also benefit patients without ARDS. Consequently, there has been increasing call to apply LTVV for all patients with acute respiratory failure upon initiation of mechanical ventilation.

The PETAL Network considered performing a pragmatic stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized, controlled, hybrid implementation trial to examine systematic implementation of a default 6 ml/kg PBW LTVV strategy in patients with acute respiratory failure requiring intubation to improve adherence to LTVV and decrease mortality in acute respiratory failure. Trial planning may be better estimated by simulation than routine, simplistic calculations, but such simulations require detailed data of initial parameters.","Use of initial tidal volumes less than 8 ml/kg predicted body weight was common at hospitals participating in the PETAL Network. After considering the size and budgetary requirement for a cluster-randomized trial of LTVV versus usual care in acute respiratory failure, the PETAL Network deemed the proposed trial infeasible.

This study was developed to examine whether use of an ICS or LTRA were effective in reducing episode-free days (EFDs) over a 12- month period in preschoolers with intermittent wheezing.","The CARE-AIMS study did not show a statistically significant response in preschool children with moderate-to-severe intermittent wheezing. Although the episodic use of budesonide or montelukast did not increase the proportion of episode-free days, it was successful in decreasing symptom severity during acute respiratory tract illnesses.

Therapy with medium to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) supplemented with additional controller medication(s) is generally effective in achieving control of symptoms. Concern over systemic side effects from long-term use of medium to high dose ICS medications has prompted physicians to seek non-steroid medications that would allow ICS doses to be decreased. The Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network initiated the Montelukast or Azithromycin for Reduction of Inhaled Corticosteroids in Childhood Asthma (MARS) protocol to explore non-corticosteroid medications, specifically a macrolide and a leukotriene receptor antagonist, which might allow reduction of daily doses of ICS so as to lower the incidence of corticosteroid side effects.","Due to enrollment and efficiency of randomization being lower than expected, a futility analysis was requested. The results of this analysis indicated that even if the planned sample size was reached, results of this study were unlikely to be different and the trial was prematurely terminated. In conclusion, neither azithromycin nor montelukast is likely to be an effective ICS-sparing alternative in children with moderate to severe persistent asthma.

The preference for ICSs was based primarily on evidence from previous clinical trials; however, few studies had addressed the factors that determine the marked variability in response to asthma control therapy. It was unknown, for example, whether patients who did not respond well to one medication might respond to the other medication. The purpose of the CARE-CLIC trial was to identify patient features that could serve as indicators for selection of the medication most likely to achieve a favorable response in individual patients.","Defining response as improvement in FEV1 of 7.5% or greater, 17% of 126 participants responded to both medications, 23% responded to fluticasone alone, 5% responded to montelukast alone, and 55% responded to neither medication. Although responses to fluticasone and montelukast varied considerably in children with asthma, children with lower pulmonary function or higher levels of markers associated with allergic inflammation should receive ICS therapy. Children without these indicators could receive a therapeutic trial of either ICS or LTRA.

While an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is effective in controlling childhood asthma, an ICS is associated with mild reduction in growth velocity. A leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) is an alternative to an ICS, but evidence suggests an ICS provides better asthma control. Another alternative is to add a long-acting β-agonist (LABA) to an ICS to allow reduction in the ICS dose, however, this has not been well studied in children. The Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network initiated the Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial (PACT) to compare the effectiveness of an ICS (fluticasone) and LABA (salmeterol) combination regimen to a regimen of the ICS alone and a regimen of a LTRA (montelukast) in controlling asthma.","In school-aged children with mild to moderate asthma, both fluticasone monotherapy and PACT combination achieved greater improvements in asthma control days than montelukast.

"LTRC","Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC)","Chronic lung diseases are a main cause of death and disability in the United States. COPD affects over 14 million individuals in the United States and represents the third leading cause of mortality. Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor. However, only one of six individuals who smoke develops COPD. This could imply either an individual susceptibility or an additional immunologic or infectious injury to lung cells. Current treatments offer symptomatic relief, but do not prevent disease progression. Better understanding of disease pathogenesis, including the potential roles of lung parenchymal cell apoptosis, immunologic injury, and inflammation may lead to therapies that improve survival and quality of life.

Interstitial pneumonias, including IPF and those associated with connective tissue disease, are less common than COPD, but for many of these diseases there are poor outcomes. For example, IPF has a 50% survival rate 2-3 years following diagnosis, and currently no treatment exists which prolongs survival. The prevalence of IPF is approximately 28 cases per 100,000. The underlying histology of IPF is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which can also occur in connective tissue diseases. The incidences of other interstitial pneumonias such as non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) are less frequent but also occur as an expression of interstitial lung disease in the connective tissue diseases. Moreover, there is significant crossover of these three interstitial pneumonias so that cases of IPF/UIP may also reveal fibrotic NSIP and be complicated by episodes of AIP. This implies common injuries but dissimilar histological responses. All of these processes are characterized by epithelial injury, uncontrolled fibroproliferation and the deposition of collagen, irrespective of the histology. It is clear that a better understanding of the genesis of the interstitial pneumonias is required before effective interventions can be developed.","LTRC established a biospecimen collection that is unique in its size, diseases included, standardization of methods, and extent of phenotypic data, serving as a valuable resource to facilitate research on the pathobiology of lung diseases.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Interstitial Lung Disease, Lung Diseases, Lung Diseases, Obstructive","The LTRC was a biobank resource established by the NHLBI to collect and distribute lung tissue, blood samples, clinical data, and radiographic studies from participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other related idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) and interstitial pneumonias associated with connective tissue diseases who undergo medically-indicated lung resection. All tissue and blood specimens and clinical data were banked centrally and stored for distribution to external investigators who have approved study proposals to investigate the pathogenesis or management of lung diseases. The ultimate goal of this program was to enable research that illuminates the pathobiology of lung diseases and leads to novel interventional treatments for these conditions.","A total of 4,486 subjects were enrolled, and lung tissue was obtained from 3,333 of these. Donors were recruited from individuals undergoing lung surgery for nodules or masses, having a biopsy for diagnosis of possible interstitial lung disease (ILD), or undergoing a therapeutic surgery for established lung disease (lung volume reduction surgery or lung transplant). Participants may or may not have had COPD or ILD as determined by their post-consent pulmonary function tests and pathological examinations, and specimens were collected regardless of post-consent pathology or lung function findings.

"CHIVES","Coupons for Healthy Intake Using Variable Economic Strategies (CHIVES)","Nutrition assistance program reforms could affect socioeconomic disparities in obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, given both the wide-spread participation in these programs and the elevated rate of nutrition-related chronic disease among low-income Americans.

Whether these nutrition assistance programs can support healthier diets by subsidizing healthier food options or restricting food options has been the subject of extensive discussion. These programs assume that providing money for specific food categories will improve dietary intake by encouraging healthier food purchasing patterns. However, most people receiving nutrition assistance also use their own money for additional food purchases. When the CHIVES study was initiated, the extent to which such assistance alters dietary intake was unclear.

Program benefits delivered in a monthly lump sum may contribute to a “consumption cycle”—the tendency for low-income Americans to spend their benefits immediately after receiving their monthly payment and then have limited money for food by month’s end. CHIVES sought to determine whether increasing the frequency of benefit delivery could meaningfully modify dietary intake as this had not yet been assessed in a randomized trial.","Receiving fruit and vegetable–only vouchers did not significantly increase fruit and vegetable consumption compared with receiving unrestricted vouchers.

"RESTORE","Randomized Evaluation of Sedation Titration for Respiratory Failure (RESTORE)","Ensuring the safety and comfort of critically ill infants and children supported by mechanical ventilation is integral to the practice of pediatric critical care. Although sedation therapy benefits young patients who cannot understand the imperative nature of invasive life-sustaining therapies, sedative use is also associated with untoward adverse effects. Specifically, opioids and benzodiazepines commonly used for pediatric sedation may impair bedside neurological assessment, depress spontaneous ventilation, and prolong mechanical ventilation. Over time, drug tolerance develops, which may precipitate iatrogenic withdrawal syndrome when sedation therapy is no longer necessary.

Numerous studies in adult critical care support a minimal yet effective approach to sedation management. Sedation goals for mechanically ventilated adults have shifted from an unresponsive state to a calm, easily aroused, readily evaluated patient. Studies in adult patients evaluating targeted sedation, daily interruption and/or titration of sedation, pairing of spontaneous awakening with breathing, and no sedation have reported improved clinical outcomes, including decreased length of mechanical ventilation when compared with usual care.

In contrast, few data inform sedation practices in pediatric critical care, and international studies describe significant practice variation. Given unique biobehavioral differences, knowledge generated in adult critical care may not translate to the care of critically ill children. The RESTORE study was conducted to test the effect of a nurse-implemented, goal-directed sedation protocol on clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with acute respiratory failure.","Among children undergoing mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, the use of a sedation protocol compared with usual care did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation. Exploratory analyses of secondary outcomes suggest a complex relationship among wakefulness, pain, and agitation (JAMA 2015; 313(4):379-89).","Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Lung Diseases, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn, Respiratory Insufficiency","The primary aim of the RESTORE clinical trial was to determine whether critically ill children managed with a nurse-implemented, goal-directed sedation protocol would experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care.","A total of 2,449 children (mean age, 4.7 years; range, 2 weeks to 17 years) mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure were enrolled in 2009-2013 and followed up until 72 hours after opioids were discontinued, 28 days, or hospital discharge."

Offering this treatment for patients with severe disease is challenging as only about 20-25% of patients expected to benefit have an HLA-matched sibling. Consequently, several transplantations have utilized an HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated adult donor and HLA-mismatched relative.  Transplantation strategies have also evolved over time that has included transplant conditioning regimens of varying intensity, grafts other than bone marrow and novel approaches to overcome the donor-recipient histocompatibility barrier and limit graft-versus-host disease.  The data that is available for sickle cell disease transplants have been utilized to report on outcomes after transplantation and compare outcomes after transplantation of grafts HLA-matched related, HLA-mismatched related, HLA-matched and HLA-mismatched unrelated donors. Collectively, these data have advanced our knowledge and understanding of hematopoietic cell transplant for this disease.  These data can also serve as “contemporaneous controls” for comparison with other more recent curative treatments like gene therapy and gene editing.","","Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation, Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Solid Tumors, Blood Cancers","The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) is a hematopoietic cell transplant registry that was established in 1972 at the Medical College of Wisconsin.

Despite major advances in understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of asthma and the development of new therapeutic modalities to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations, effective therapies are not widely used in the pediatric health care community. Furthermore, the long-term effects and side effects of asthma medications in children, especially children under the age of 12 years, are not well understood. Treatment of school-age children using inhaled corticosteroids has been associated with improvements in asthma control, however these improvements were not sustained after medication discontinuation. The PEAK investigators hypothesized that a sustained effect may be observed in patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids early in life, prior to the development of persistent disease and chronic loss of lung function.","The CARE-PEAK study did not show a statistically significant response in children at high risk for asthma.

A large, multicenter trial conducted a decade before this study reported that the early administration of a 48-hour infusion of neuromuscular blockade in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen [Pao2] to the fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2] of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of ≥5 cm of water) resulted in lower mortality than a strategy of deep sedation without routine neuromuscular blockade. Despite these encouraging results, early neuromuscular blockade has not been widely adopted. Potential concerns include the lack of research comparing neuromuscular blockade and deep sedation with current practice (which promotes lighter sedation targets) as well as limited data on the effect of neuromuscular blockade on neuromuscular function and other long-term outcomes. Therefore, the PETAL-ROSE study was initiated to determine the efficacy and safety of early neuromuscular blockade with concomitant heavy sedation as compared with a strategy of usual care with lighter sedation targets.","After the second interim analysis, the decision to stop the trial for futility was made independently by the data and safety monitoring board.

Despite extensive literature demonstrating the hazards of sleep deprivation, however, questions have persisted about whether the 2011 ACGME standards would be beneficial, as this mandate increased the number of handovers of care and may lead to decreases in staffing and physician-patient ratios. Prior studies evaluating the effects on the safety of the ACGME’s 2011 standards have shown mixed results. Furthermore, the outcomes in these prior studies may not have been sufficiently sensitive to measure important adverse effects and did not rigorously capture the work hours, sleep, or neurobehavioral performance of the resident-physicians. In addition, most prior studies have not assessed the effects of roster changes on PGY2 and higher resident-physicians.","Resident physicians who were randomly assigned to schedules that eliminated extended shifts made more serious errors than resident physicians assigned to schedules with extended shifts, although the effect varied by site.

"REVIVAL","Registry Evaluation of Vital Information for VADs in Ambulatory Life (REVIVAL)","Identification of patients at high risk for mortality is vital to advance cardiac therapies. Heart failure scores based on results from earlier clinical trials have generally underestimated mortality in advanced heart failure. Breakthroughs in mechanical circulatory support (MCS) have extended survival and quality of life measures in the most advanced heart failure patients. Increased survival of advanced heart failure patients combined with shortages of donor organs resulted in the United Network to Organ Sharing (UNOS) limiting priority to hospitalized patients or those on MCS. Consequently, those patients who were “less sick” were de-prioritized for transplantation, which resulted in a need to decrease mortality and morbidity through other therapies. There was limited evidence on the clinical characteristics of patients that would benefit the most from MCS compared to new medical therapies such as Left-ventricular assisted device (LVAD).  The REVIVAL study was initiated with the broader goal of improving prognostic assessment in chronic, ambulatory, advanced systolic heart failure and to better inform the selection of appropriate candidates for future studies on additional strategies.","","Heart Failure, Heart Failure, Congestive","To provide a greater understanding of the clinical trajectory of ambulatory patients with chronic, advanced, systolic heart failure that may benefit from ventricular assisted device (VAD) therapy and determine the relationship between baseline clinical measures and prognosis.","REVIVAL enrolled 400 subjects from participating study sites.

"BMT CTN-1204","Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) Reduced Intensity Conditioning for Children and Adults With Hemophagocytic Syndromes or Selected Primary Immune Deficiencies (1204)","Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is required for long-term survival in many patients with primary defects of the immune system.  The major obstacles to long-term survival in these patients, many of whom have significant morbidities at the time of transplant, are treatment-related mortality and durable immune reconstitution.  Several studies have shown that reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) significantly improved outcomes in patients with immune deficiencies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).  However, the decrease in treatment-related morbidity and mortality comes with increased risk of inadequate durable engraftment.  In an institutional case series of patients with HLH and related disorders, “intermediate” (Day -14) timing of alemtuzumab administration maintained excellent survival rates with improved stable engraftment.

Although a RIC approach for HLH appears to be effective, the optimal dose and timing of alemtuzumab and other therapeutic agents used in conditioning to achieve maximum survival with improved engraftment remained to be defined. Therefore, this study was initiated to test the efficacy of intermediate-timed alemtuzumab as part of a RIC protocol in patients with HLH and other primary immunodeficiencies.","Although the RIC provided successful engraftment in the majority of patients, the regimen cannot be considered safe for widespread adoption without modification due to regimen-related toxicity and the high rate of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which was the predominant cause of mortality.

"HFN-ATHENA HF","Heart Failure Network (HFN) Aldosterone Targeted Neurohormonal Combined with Natriuresis Therapy - HF (ATHENA HF)","Acute heart failure (AHF) accounts for more than a million hospitalizations in the United States annually. The role of low-dose mineralocorticoid receptors antagonists (MRAs) therapy as a neurohormonal antagonist is well established for the treatment of chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. However, the role of high-dose MRA therapy in AHF remained uncertain. A previous clinical trial suggested that the benefits of high-dose MRA therapy in AHF included lower natriuretic peptide levels, less congestion, better renal function, and less need for an intravenous diuretic.

The use of intravenous loop diuretics can intensify secondary hyperaldosteronism among AHF patients and hyperaldosteronism directly contributes to diuretic resistance in AHF. Elevated aldosterone levels in AHF are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and HF readmission. Hospitalizations for heart failure are associated with increased risk of mortality and/or readmission.

The standard treatment has been high-dose corticosteroids, which are only effective in about half of patients and have significant toxicities.

Recently, clinical and blood biomarker-based tools have been developed to estimate the likelihood of initial response to steroid treatment and subsequent risk for mortality in acute GVHD. The Minnesota (MN) GVHD Risk Score uses acute GVHD organ involvement and severity to identify standard-risk (SR) vs high-risk (HR) status at onset of GVHD. The Ann Arbor (AA) biomarker risk uses 2 serum biomarkers at acute GVHD onset to generate a score from 1 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater mortality risk.

To develop these novel cell therapies, there is a need for both healthy and SCD CD34+ cells for use in preclinical development and in validation of these therapeutic approaches. One of the challenges in obtaining SCD CD34+ HSCs is that mobilization and collection of these cells is challenging due to technical limitations of the apheresis procedure. Moreover, peripheral blood mobilization of stem cells in SCD patients is limited to plerixafor as G-CSF is contraindicated in SCD thus obtaining relatively fewer cells at collection.

There are several shared pathological features between AIC and heart failure (HF). A promising approach to treatment of HF is the administration of bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). The SENECA trial was the first-in-human study of allo-MSCs in patients with LV dysfunction secondary to AIC.","The SENECA trial demonstrated that allo-MSCs are well-tolerated and that transendocardial injections of allo-MSCs are feasible in patients with AIC.  Although the SENECA trial was not designed to test efficacy, a subset of participants was included in secondary endpoint analysis. The only statistically significant differences observed were with the MLHFQ and 6MWT assessments which favored the intervention. Larger studies will be required to determine the efficacy of allo-MSCs treatment.

"BMT CTN-1203","Blood and Marrow Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) A Multi-center Phase II Trial Randomizing Novel Approaches for Graft-versus-Host Disease Prevention Compared to Contemporary Controls (1203)","Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality after allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Over the last few decades, the combination of methotrexate and a calcineurin inhibitor have been the standard treatment for GVHD prevention. However, over 50% of patients develop GVHD after HCT. Moreover, in patients who develop GVHD and fail to respond to treatment, survival is poor due to infectious complications, organ failure and toxicity of immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, a strategy is needed that minimizes the incidence of GVHD, without other adverse effects.

The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 1203 trial was initiated to prospectively study three promising interventions for GVHD prevention compared to a contemporary control.","The tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil/post-transplant cyclophosphamide intervention had better GVHD-free, relapse-free survival compared to the control. Based on these findings, a phase III clinical trial will be launched to compare high-dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide with methotrexate and calcineurin inhibitor for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis.

"DELTA","Dietary Effects on Lipoproteins and Thrombogenic Activity (DELTA)","Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death globally. The American Heart Association recommends a diet that, among other characteristics, is low in saturated fatty acid (SFA), trans fat, and sodium to decrease atherosclerotic CVD risk factors. In addition, several hemostatic factors that affect CVD risk, notably fibrinogen, factor VIIc, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), may also be modifiable, in part, by type and amount of dietary fat. The Dietary Effects on Lipoproteins and Thrombogenic Activity (DELTA) Study was conducted to evaluate the effects of diet modifications, particularly substituting carbohydrates and unsaturated fats for SFA, on lipids, lipoproteins, and hemostatic factors in various population groups, including those at high risk of CVD.","In DELTA-1, stepwise reductions in SFA resulted in parallel reductions in plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels. Diet effects were remarkably similar in several age-related subgroups of men and women and in age-related Whites and African Americans. The reductions in total and LDL cholesterol achieved in these different subgroups indicate that diet likely can have a significant impact on risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the general U.S. population. In DELTA-2, where participants were at increased risk of coronary artery disease, MUFA provided a greater reduction in risk factors than did carbohydrate as a replacement for saturated fat. An evaluation of menstrual cycle and menopausal status effects conducted in DELTA-1 participants found that, under conditions of tight dietary control, the variability in hemostatic factors in premenopausal women was no greater than for postmenopausal women or men. Consequently, premenopausal women can be included in studies investigating hemostatic factor responses without controlling for stage of menstrual cycle.

For hemostatic/thrombogenic factors, a combined analysis of DELTA-1 and DELTA-2 results showed that reducing SFA modestly lowers factor VIIc in healthy individuals and those at-risk for CVD. A diet low in total fat and SFA (i.e., higher in carbohydrate) elicited a greater mean increase in fibrinogen than a moderate fat diet that was low in SFA and high in MUFA. These results indicate that, as a substitute for SFA, MUFA compared with carbohydrate results in a lesser degree of increase in fibrinogen. The results regarding the diet effects on PAI-1 were inconclusive.

Treatment with DNA hypomethylating agents can improve hematologic parameters, reduce transfusion requirements, delay transformation to acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML), and prolong progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in individuals with higher-risk disease. However, fewer than half of the patients with MDS achieve objective responses to hypomethylating therapy, and these responses are usually of limited duration. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative therapy for MDS and an established therapy for younger patients with MDS. Allogeneic HCT does carry the risk of early transplant-related mortality. Although transplantation outcomes among selected older individuals with MDS are similar to those in younger patients with MDS, early transplantation for older individuals is not broadly accepted. Statistical modeling analyses demonstrate the benefits of early HCT in older populations, and two prospective studies from European groups showed a benefit of HCT over non-HCT therapy when a suitable donor is available. The BMT CTN-1102 clinical trial was designed to evaluate the relative benefits of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT compared to non-transplant therapies in older patients.","There was a significant 3-year overall survival advantage in older MDS subjects who were RIC HCT candidates with matched donors identified when compared with those without a donor. Based on this study, HCT should be included as an integral part of MDS management plans in fit older adults with higher-risk MDS.

"PF-ILD Proteomics","Proteomic biomarkers of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease: a multicentre cohort analysis (PF-ILD Proteomics)","Progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a devastating condition characterized by parenchymal scar formation, leading to deteriorating lung function and early death. Whereas almost all patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) progress, a variable proportion of patients with other common ILDs, including connective tissue disease associated ILD, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and unclassifiable ILD, develop progressive fibrosing ILD. There are criteria that effectively identify those experiencing ILD progression. However, the criteria do not allow patients who are at risk to be identified before progression occurs. 

Several blood-based biomarkers have been linked to differential progression in patients with IPF and other fibrosing ILDs. Inflammatory signaling also appears to have a prominent role in fibrotic-predominant ILDs. As such, cytokines, interleukins, and other immune mediators might serve as useful biomarkers of progressive fibrosing ILD. The PF-ILD Proteomics study was a targeted investigation of inflammation-related proteins to identify and validate novel biomarkers of progressive fibrosing ILD in patients with fibrotic connective tissue disease-associated ILD, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and unclassifiable ILD.","17 plasma biomarkers of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease were identified and showed consistent associations across ILD subtypes.

"ISCHEMIA/ISCHEMIA-CKD","International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) and ISCHEMIA - Chronic Kidney Disease (ISCHEMIA - CKD)","Evidence from clinical trials of stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) supports the use of intensive lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the likelihood of major adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular (CV) death. In addition to this secondary prevention, many patients also undergo routine cardiac catheterization and revascularization as part of their management. Clinical trial evidence to date, however, has failed to demonstrate that an initial invasive strategy reduces death or MI as compared with an initial conservative strategy of optimal medical therapy (OMT) in SIHD patients. Most of the pivotal randomized comparisons between medicine and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were conducted before the use of current pharmacologic therapies, such as statins. More recent trials using contemporary medical therapy do not include large numbers of higher-risk participants to test whether an invasive approach with OMT reduces risk in patients with more advanced SIHD as compared with OMT alone. Thus, the motivating premise for the ISCHEMIA Trial was to determine whether routine cardiac catheterization and revascularization, when feasible, improves prognosis in patients with more severe ischemia who may derive the greatest clinical benefit from an invasive approach.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease. The presence of kidney disease has been associated with an increased risk of procedural complications from coronary angiography and revascularization and it remains uncertain whether a routine invasive approach when compared with a conservative strategy is beneficial in such patients.  Most trials involving patients with cardiovascular disease have either excluded patients with advanced kidney disease or included too few to permit a confident estimation of treatment benefits. ISCHEMIA-CKD was conducted to test whether there is incremental benefit of an invasive strategy in patients with stable coronary disease and advanced chronic kidney disease.","Among patients with SIHD and moderate or severe ischemia, there was no evidence that an initial invasive strategy, as compared with an initial conservative strategy, reduced the risk of ischemic cardiovascular events or death from any cause.

The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), such as tacrolimus (Tac), with methotrexate (MTX) has been the basis of most GVHD prophylaxis regimens worldwide. However, this standard approach does not effectively prevent chronic GVHD.

The incidence of chronic GVHD is affected by graft source, with mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) having higher rates and more severe manifestations compared with bone marrow (BM) grafts. Recognition that GVHD is mediated by donor-derived T cells led to exploration of strategies for T-cell depletion that could be used in treatment plans. One approach involves CD34 selected T-cell depletion in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. Another approach involves infusion of BM grafts followed by post-transplant Cyclophosphamide (PTCy).

The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 1301 trial was established to compare the CNI-free treatment plans for reduction of chronic GVHD to one another and to a Tac/MTX control in patients with HLA-matched donors.","This study demonstrated that both experimental arms resulted in similar but not better outcomes compared with HCT using standard Tac and MTX with BM graft as measured by chronic GVHD-free relapse-free survival.

"PETAL-CLOVERS","Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS)","Intravenous fluid resuscitation is a common therapy used in the initial treatment of patients with septic shock and sepsis-induced hypotension. The goal of initial fluid therapy is to increase depleted or functionally reduced intravascular volume that occurs in sepsis due to a vasodilated vascular network. However, intravenous fluid resuscitation can create dilutional coagulopathy, fluid overload, and pathogenic edema in the lungs and other organs. Vasopressor agents are also commonly used to treat hypoperfusion by inducing constriction of arterioles and venules and increasing cardiac contractility. Vasopressor therapy also comes with risks that include vasoconstriction resulting in tissue ischemia, increased cardiac workload, and arrhythmias. Clinicians have used these strategies, typically in combination, to provide supportive care for patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. However, at the time of the CLOVERS study, there was limited data to guide specific use of these therapies, including fluid volumes, in the early care of patients with sepsis-induced hypotension. The CLOVERS study hypothesized that a restrictive fluid strategy used during the first 24-hours of resuscitation for sepsis-induced hypotension would lead to lower mortality before discharge home by day 90 than a liberal fluid strategy.","Among patients with sepsis-induced hypotension, the restrictive fluid strategy that was used in this trial did not result in significantly lower (or higher) mortality, or other measures of recovery such as length of hospital stay, before discharge home by day 90 than the liberal fluid strategy.

PMID: 36688507.","Septic Shock","To compare the effects of a restrictive fluid strategy (with early use of vasopressors) to a liberal fluid strategy in patients with sepsis-induced hypotension.","Adult patients (>18 years of age) with a suspected or confirmed infection (broadly defined as the administration or planned administration of antibiotic agents) and sepsis-induced hypotension (systolic blood pressure, <100 mm Hg after the administration of ≥1000 ml of intravenous fluid) were eligible. Key exclusion criteria were an elapse of more than 4 hours since the meeting of the criteria for hypotension refractory to the intravenous administration of at least 1000 ml of fluid, an elapse of more than 24 hours since presentation at the hospital, previous receipt of more than 3000 ml of intravenous fluid during this episode (including prehospital administration of fluid by emergency medical services), the presence of fluid overload, and severe volume depletion from non-sepsis causes.

A total of 1563 patients, from 60 medical centers, of the planned 2,230 participants were enrolled, with 782 assigned to the restrictive fluid group and 781 to the liberal fluid group. Enrollment in the trial was ended after the second interim analysis due to a lack of significant difference observed between the two 24-hour strategies."
"CTSN-MMR","Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) Surgical Interventions for Moderate Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation (MMR)","People with coronary artery disease (CAD) are at increased risk of having a myocardial infarction. Following an infarction, approximately 50% of people develop a leak in the mitral valve of the heart. This condition is known as ischemic mitral regurgitation and is associated with poor health outcomes. In people with severe mitral valve leakage, the coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure and a mitral valve repair procedure are routinely performed together. However, the benefits of adding mitral-valve repair are uncertain in people with moderate mitral valve leakage. This is because mitral-valve repair results in longer durations of aortic cross-clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass that increases perioperative risk. The CTSN-MMR trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding mitral-valve repair to CABG for patients with CAD and moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation.","In patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, the addition of mitral-valve repair to CABG, as compared with CABG alone, was not associated with greater improvement in the LVESVI at 1 year after surgery.

"HFN-LIFE","Heart Failure Network (HFN) - EntrestoTM (LCZ696) In Advanced Heart Failure (LIFE)","Treatment with evidence-based medical therapies improves survival, reduces heart failure hospitalizations, and improves quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. However, evidence supporting the use of medical therapies among patients with advanced heart failure is limited. Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure are not often enrolled in clinical trials.

A previous trial reported that, compared with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan, an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, reduced the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalizations by 20% in ambulatory patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. Although patients with NYHA class IV heart failure were eligible to enroll, this population was underrepresented. The HFN-LIFE trial was initiated to provide additional information about the tolerability, safety, and potential efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with advanced heart failure.","In patients with chronic advanced heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, there was no statistically significant difference between sacubitril/valsartan and valsartan alone with respect to reducing NT-proBNP levels.
