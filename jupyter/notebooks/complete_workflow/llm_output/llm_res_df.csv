While this is important, ""CONSENT STATUS"" provides a broader view of the participant\'s consent status, which may be more relevant for harmonizing the new variable.', '', 'To align the new variable ""Consent group as determined by DAC"" with the selected existing variable ""CONSENT STATUS,"" the user should ensure that the definitions and criteria for determining consent groups by the DAC (Data Access Committee) are clearly documented and aligned with the categories or values used in the ""CONSENT STATUS"" variable. This alignment will help ensure consistency and accuracy in data reporting and analysis.', '', 'If there is no clear match between the new variable and any of the existing variables, it may be necessary to further clarify the specific criteria and definitions used in determining consent groups by the DAC and consider creating a new variable or category in the data repository that accurately captures this information.'])"
