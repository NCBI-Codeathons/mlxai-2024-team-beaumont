## Project Goals
The goal of projectname is to build a system for harmonizing your data with the data that already exists within a data repository such as NCBI or NHLBI BDC. Harmonization is a major challenge for all research repositories as data sources do not have either the clear direction and/or the resources to align data before ingest. This results in retrospective data harmonization that must done by the data users or through manual harmonization efforts by the repository teams. The projectname system evaluates the potential for retrieval augmented generation and AI reasoning to provide an evaluation mechanisms for determining how new data provided through a data dictionary as an input aligns with the corpus of data available within a repository.

## Approach
The following outlines our approach and methods for project name

**Methods**
We took scraped data dictionaries available publically for BioLINCC studies
