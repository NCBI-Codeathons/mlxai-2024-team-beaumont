## Project Goals
The goal of dataragtag is to build a system for harmonizing incoming data with the data that already exsists within a data repository. Harmonization is a major challenge for all research repositories as data sources largely do not have either the clear guidance and/or resources to align data before ingest. This results in restrospective data harmonization that must done by the data users or through manual harmonization efforts. The dataragtaq system evaluates the potential for retrieval augmented generation to provide an evaulation mechnaisms for determining how new data provided through a data dictionary aligns with the corpus of data availabile within a repository. 

## Approach
This is a RAG system using multiple LLM models and a Vector DB
